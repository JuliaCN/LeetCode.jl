# 
# We are given the `root` node of a _maximum tree:_ a tree where every node has
# a value greater than any other value in its subtree.
# 
# Just as in the [previous problem](https://leetcode.comhttps://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-
# binary-tree/), the given tree was constructed from an list `A` (`root =
# Construct(A)`) recursively with the following `Construct(A)` routine:
# 
#   * If `A` is empty, return `null`.
#   * Otherwise, let `A[i]` be the largest element of `A`.  Create a `root` node with value `A[i]`.
#   * The left child of `root` will be `Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])`
#   * The right child of `root` will be `Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])`
#   * Return `root`.
# 
# Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node `root =
# Construct(A)`.
# 
# Suppose `B` is a copy of `A` with the value `val` appended to it.  It is
# guaranteed that `B` has unique values.
# 
# Return `Construct(B)`.
# 
#

# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
#     Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
#     Explanation: A = [1,4,2,3], B = [1,4,2,3,5]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**

# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
#     Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]
#     Explanation: A = [2,1,5,4], B = [2,1,5,4,3]
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
# **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/21/maximum-binary-
# tree-3-1.png)![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/21/maximum-

# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4
#     Output: [5,2,4,null,1,3]
#     Explanation: A = [2,1,5,3], B = [2,1,5,3,4]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= B.length <= 100`
