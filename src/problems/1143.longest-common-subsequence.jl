# 
# Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest
# common subsequence.
# 
# A _subsequence_ of a string is a new string generated from the original string
# with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order
# of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while
# "aec" is not). A _common subsequence_  of two strings is a subsequence that is
# common to both strings.
# 
# 
# 
# If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
#     Output: 3  
#     Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
#     Output: 0
#     Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
#   * `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
#   * The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
