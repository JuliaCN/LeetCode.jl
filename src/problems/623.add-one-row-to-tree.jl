# 
# Given the root of a binary tree, then value `v` and depth `d`, you need to add
# a row of nodes with value `v` at the given depth `d`. The root node is at
# depth 1.
# 
# The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth `d`, for each NOT null tree
# nodes `N` in depth `d-1`, create two tree nodes with value `v` as `N's` left
# subtree root and right subtree root. And `N's` **original left subtree**
# should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its **original right
# subtree** should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth
# `d` is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with
# value **v** as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree
# is the new root's left subtree.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 
#     A binary tree as following:
#            4
#          /   \
#         2     6
#        / \   / 
#       3   1 5   
#     
#     **v = 1**
#     
#     **d = 2**
#     
#     Output: 
#            4
#           / \
#          1   1
#         /     \
#        2       6
#       / \     / 
#      3   1   5   
#     
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 
#     A binary tree as following:
#           4
#          /   
#         2    
#        / \   
#       3   1    
#     
#     **v = 1**
#     
#     **d = 3**
#     
#     Output: 
#           4
#          /   
#         2
#        / \    
#       1   1
#      /     \  
#     3       1
#     
# 
# **Note:**  
# 
#   1. The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].
#   2. The given binary tree has at least one tree node.
#
