# 
# Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top
# left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
# 
# **Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/minpath.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
#     Output: 7
#     Explanation: Because the path 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 minimizes the sum.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
#     Output: 12
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `m == grid.length`
#   * `n == grid[i].length`
#   * `1 <= m, n <= 200`
#   * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
#
