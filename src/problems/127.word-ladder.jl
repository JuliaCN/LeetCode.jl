# [127] Word Ladder
#= 
Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from begin_word to end_word, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
Note:

Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume begin_word and end_word are non-empty and are not the same.
Example 1:

Input:
begin_word = "hit",
end_word = "cog",
word_list = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
Example 2:

Input:
begin_word = "hit"
end_word = "cog"
word_list = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The end_word "cog" is not in word_list, therefore no possible transformation. =#
