# 
# Given two words ( _beginWord_ and _endWord_ ), and a dictionary's word list,
# find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to
# _endWord_ , such that:
# 
#   1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
#   2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
#   * All words have the same length.
#   * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
#   * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
#   * You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     beginWord = "hit",
#     endWord = "cog",
#     wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
#     
#     Output: 5
#     
#     Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
#     return its length 5.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     beginWord = "hit"
#     endWord = "cog"
#     wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
#     
#     Output:  0
#     
#     Explanation:  The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible ** ** transformation.
