# 
# Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard
# heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
# 
# Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm
# radius range.
# 
# Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return
# _the minimum radius standard of heaters  so that those heaters could cover all
# houses._
# 
# **Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm
# radius will the same.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
#     Output: 1
#     Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
#     Output: 1
#     Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
#     Output: 3
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 104`
#   * `1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 109`
#
