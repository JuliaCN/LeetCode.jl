# 
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two
# given nodes in the BST.
# 
# According to the [definition of LCA on
# Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest
# common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T
# that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a
# descendant of itself** )."
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
#     Output: 6
#     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
#     Output: 2
#     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
#   * `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
#   * All `Node.val` are **unique**.
#   * `p != q`
#   * `p` and `q` will exist in the BST.
#
