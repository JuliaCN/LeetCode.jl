# 
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to
# you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., `[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]` might become `[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]`).
# 
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`,
# otherwise return `false`.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
#     Output: true
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
#     Output: false
# 
# **Follow up:**
# 
#   * This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain duplicates.
#   * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
