# 
# Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first
# element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The
# Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
# traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to
# find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [1,2,1]
#     Output: [2,-1,2]
#     Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; The number 2 can't find next greater number; The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
#     
# 
# **Note:** The length of given array won't exceed 10000.
