# 
# You are given an array `points`, an integer `angle`, and your `location`,
# where `location = [posx, posy]` and `points[i] = [xi, yi]` both denote
# **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane.
# 
# Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You **cannot
# move** from your position, but you can **rotate**. In other words, `posx` and
# `posy` cannot be changed. Your field of view in **degrees** is represented by
# `angle`, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let
# `d` be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your
# field of view is the **inclusive** range of angles `[d - angle/2, d +
# angle/2]`.
# 
# Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.
# 
# You can **see** some set of points if, for each point, the **angle** formed by
# the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position
# is **in your field of view**.
# 
# There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your
# location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation.
# Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.
# 
# Return _the maximum number of points you can see_.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**

# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/30/89a07e9b-00ab-4967-976a-c723b2aa8656.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,3]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: The shaded region represents your field of view. All points can be made visible in your field of view, including [3,3] even though [2,2] is in front and in the same line of sight.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: points = [[2,1],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]], angle = 90, location = [1,1]
#     Output: 4
#     Explanation: All points can be made visible in your field of view, including the one at your location.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/30/5010bfd3-86e6-465f-ac64-e9df941d2e49.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: points = [[1,0],[2,1]], angle = 13, location = [1,1]
#     Output: 1
#     Explanation: You can only see one of the two points, as shown above.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= points.length <= 105`
#   * `points[i].length == 2`
#   * `location.length == 2`
#   * `0 <= angle < 360`
#   * `0 <= posx, posy, xi, yi <= 109`
#
