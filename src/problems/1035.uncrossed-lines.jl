# 
# We write the integers of `A` and `B` (in the order they are given) on two
# separate horizontal lines.
# 
# Now, we may draw _connecting lines_ : a straight line connecting two numbers
# `A[i]` and `B[j]` such that:
# 
#   * `A[i] == B[j]`;
#   * The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
# 
# Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each
# number can only belong to one connecting line.
# 
# Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/26/142.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
#     Output: 2
#     Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
#     We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
#     Output: 3
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
#     Output: 2
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `1 <= A.length <= 500`
#   2. `1 <= B.length <= 500`
#   3. `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000`
#
