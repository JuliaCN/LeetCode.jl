Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some
starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The
path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the
root.

Example 1:


Input: [1,2,3]

⁠      1
⁠     / \
⁠    2   3

Output: 6


Example 2:


Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

-10
/ \
9  20
/  \
15   7

Output: 42
