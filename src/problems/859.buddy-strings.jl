Testcase Example:  '"ab"\n"ba"'

Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true if you can swap
two letters in A so the result is equal to B, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such
that i != j and swapping the characters at A[i] and A[j]. For example,
swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".


Example 1:


Input: A = "ab", B = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is
equal to B.


Example 2:


Input: A = "ab", B = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b',
which results in "ba" != B.


Example 3:


Input: A = "aa", B = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is
equal to B.


Example 4:


Input: A = "aaaaaaabc", B = "aaaaaaacb"
Output: true


Example 5:


Input: A = "", B = "aa"
Output: false



Constraints:


0 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= B.length <= 20000
A and B consist of lowercase letters.
