# 
# Given the `root` of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in **in-order**
# so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every
# node has no left child and only one right child.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/17/ex1.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]
#     Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/17/ex2.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [5,1,7]
#     Output: [1,null,5,null,7]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
#   * `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
