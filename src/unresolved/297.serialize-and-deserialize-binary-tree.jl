# 
# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
# same or another computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
# You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
# this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# **Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode
# serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to
# follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different
# approaches yourself.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
#     Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = []
#     Output: []
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [1]
#     Output: [1]
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [1,2]
#     Output: [1,2]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
#   * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
