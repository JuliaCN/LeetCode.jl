# 
# Given a positive integer _n_ , break it into the sum of **at least** two
# positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the
# maximum product you can get.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 2
#     Output: 1
#     Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 10
#     Output: 36
#     Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
# 
# **Note** : You may assume that _n_ is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
