# 
# All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`,
# `'G'`, and `'T'`, for example: `"ACGAATTCCG"`. When studying DNA, it is
# sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
# 
# Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
# occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
#     Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
#     Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `0 <= s.length <= 105`
#   * `s[i]` is `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.
