# 
# Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers where _n_ > 1,  return an array `output`
# such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums`
# except `nums[i]`.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:  [1,2,3,4]
#     Output: [24,12,8,6]
#     
# 
# **Constraint:**  It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any
# prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit
# integer.
# 
# **Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O( _n_ ).
# 
# **Follow up:**  
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array **does
# not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
