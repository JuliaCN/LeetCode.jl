# 
# There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in a
# two-dimensional garden. Your job is to fence the entire garden using the
# **minimum length** of rope as it is expensive. The garden is well fenced only
# if all the trees are enclosed. Your task is to help find the coordinates of
# trees which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
#     Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]

# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]
#     Output: [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]

#     Even you only have trees in a line, you need to use rope to enclose them. 
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. All trees should be enclosed together. You cannot cut the rope to enclose trees that will separate them in more than one group.
#   2. All input integers will range from 0 to 100.
#   3. The garden has at least one tree.
#   4. All coordinates are distinct.
#   5. Input points have **NO** order. No order required for output.
#   6. input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.
