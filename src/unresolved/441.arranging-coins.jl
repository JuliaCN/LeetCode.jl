# 
# You have a total of _n_ coins that you want to form in a staircase shape,
# where every _k_ -th row must have exactly _k_ coins.
# 
# Given _n_ , find the total number of **full** staircase rows that can be
# formed.
# 
# _n_ is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed
# integer.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     n = 5
#     
#     The coins can form the following rows:
#     ¤
#     ¤ ¤
#     ¤ ¤
#     
#     Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     n = 8
#     
#     The coins can form the following rows:
#     ¤
#     ¤ ¤
#     ¤ ¤ ¤
#     ¤ ¤
#     
#     Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
