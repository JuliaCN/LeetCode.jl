# 
# Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return
# _the length of the **longest palindrome**_  that can be built with those
# letters.
# 
# Letters are **case sensitive** , for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a
# palindrome here.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "abccccdd"
#     Output: 7
#     Explanation:
#     One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "a"
#     Output: 1
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "bb"
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
#   * `s` consits of lower-case **and/or** upper-case English letters only.
