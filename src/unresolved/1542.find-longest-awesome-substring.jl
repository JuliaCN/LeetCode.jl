# 
# Given a string `s`. An _awesome_ substring is a non-empty substring of `s`
# such that we can make any number of swaps in order to make it palindrome.
# 
# Return the length of the maximum length **awesome substring** of `s`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "3242415"
#     Output: 5
#     Explanation: "24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142" with some swaps.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "12345678"
#     Output: 1
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "213123"
#     Output: 6
#     Explanation: "213123" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "231132" with some swaps.
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "00"
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
#   * `s` consists only of digits.
