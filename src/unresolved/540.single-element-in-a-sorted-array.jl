# 
# You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element
# appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find
# this single element that appears only once.
# 
# **Follow up:** Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
#     Output: 10
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
#   * `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
