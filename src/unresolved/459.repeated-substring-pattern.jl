# 
# Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring
# of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume
# the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length
# will not exceed 10000.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "abab"
#     Output: True
#     Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "aba"
#     Output: False
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "abcabcabcabc"
#     Output: True
#     Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
