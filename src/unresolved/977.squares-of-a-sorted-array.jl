# 
# Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return _an
# array of **the squares of each number**  sorted in non-decreasing order_.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
#     Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
#     Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
#     After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
#     Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
#   * `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
#   * `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
