# 
# Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can
# return the answer in **any order**.
# 
# An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a
# different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
# once.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
#     Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: strs = [""]
#     Output: [[""]]
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: strs = ["a"]
#     Output: [["a"]]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
#   * `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
#   * `strs[i]` consists of lower-case English letters.
