# 
# You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle
# multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational
# capacity but **cannot handle more than one request at a time**. The requests
# are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
# 
#   * The `ith` (0-indexed) request arrives.
#   * If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
#   * If the `(i % k)th` server is available, assign the request to that server.
#   * Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the `ith` server is busy, try to assign the request to the `(i+1)th` server, then the `(i+2)th` server, and so on.
# 
# You are given a **strictly increasing** array `arrival` of positive integers,
# where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `ith` request, and
# another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the `ith` request
# (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the **busiest
# server(s)**. A server is considered **busiest** if it handled the most number
# of requests successfully among all the servers.
# 
# Return _a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the **busiest server(s)**_.
# You may return the IDs in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/08/load-1.png)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
#     Output: [1] 
#     Explanation:
#     All of the servers start out available.
#     The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
#     Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
#     Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
#     Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
#     Output: [0]
#     Explanation:
#     The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
#     Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
#     Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
#     Output: [0,1,2]
#     Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,8,9,10], load = [5,2,10,3,1,2,2]
#     Output: [1]
#     
# 
# **Example 5:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: k = 1, arrival = [1], load = [1]
#     Output: [0]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= k <= 105`
#   * `1 <= arrival.length, load.length <= 105`
#   * `arrival.length == load.length`
#   * `1 <= arrival[i], load[i] <= 109`
#   * `arrival` is **strictly increasing**.
