# 
# We are given an array `A` of positive integers, and two positive integers `L`
# and `R` (`L <= R`).
# 
# Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of
# the maximum array element in that subarray is at least `L` and at most `R`.
# 
#     
#     
#     **Example :**
#     Input: 
#     A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
#     L = 2
#     R = 3
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * L, R  and `A[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.
#   * The length of `A` will be in the range of `[1, 50000]`.
