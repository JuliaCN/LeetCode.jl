# 
# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
# strings.
# 
# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
#     Output: "fl"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
#     Output: ""
#     Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `0 <= strs.length <= 200`
#   * `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
#   * `strs[i]` consists of only lower-case English letters.
