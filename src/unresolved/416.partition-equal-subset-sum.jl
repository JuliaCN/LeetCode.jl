# 
# Given a **non-empty** array `nums` containing **only positive integers** ,
# find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of
# elements in both subsets is equal.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
#     Output: false
#     Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
#   * `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
