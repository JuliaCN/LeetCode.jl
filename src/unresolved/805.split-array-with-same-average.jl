# 
# In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B
# or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)
# 
# Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average
# value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.
# 
#     
#     
#     **Example :**
#     Input: 
#     [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * The length of `A` will be in the range [1, 30].
#   * `A[i]` will be in the range of `[0, 10000]`.
