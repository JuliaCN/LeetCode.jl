# 
# Your are given an array of positive integers `nums`.
# 
# Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all
# the elements in the subarray is less than `k`.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
#     Output: 8
#     Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
#     Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
# * `0 < nums.length <= 50000`.
# * `0 < nums[i] < 1000`.
# * `0 <= k < 10^6`.
