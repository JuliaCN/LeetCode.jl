# 
# Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For
# negative integer, [two’s
# complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. All letters in hexadecimal (`a-f`) must be in lowercase.
#   2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading `0`s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
#   3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
#   4. You **must not use _any_ method provided by the library** which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     26
#     
#     Output:
#     "1a"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     -1
#     
#     Output:
#     "ffffffff"
#
