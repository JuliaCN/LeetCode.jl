# 
# Given an array consisting of `n` integers, find the contiguous subarray of
# given length `k` that has the maximum average value. And you need to output
# the maximum average value.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
#     Output: 12.75
#     Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 30,000.
#   2. Elements of the given array will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
