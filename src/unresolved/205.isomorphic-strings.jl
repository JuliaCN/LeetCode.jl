# 
# Given two strings **_s_** and **_t_** , determine if they are isomorphic.
# 
# Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in **_s_** can be replaced to get
# **_t_**.
# 
# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
# preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
# character but a character may map to itself.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: **_s_** = "egg", **_t =_**"add"
#     Output: true
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: **_s_** = "foo", **_t =_**"bar"
#     Output: false
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: **_s_** = "paper", **_t =_**"title"
#     Output: true
# 
# **Note:**  
# You may assume both **_s  _**and **_t  _**have the same length.
