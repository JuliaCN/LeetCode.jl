# 
# For some fixed `N`, an array `A` is _beautiful_ if it is a permutation of the
# integers `1, 2, ..., N`, such that:
# 
# For every `i < j`, there is **no**  `k` with `i < k < j` such that `A[k] * 2 =
# A[i] + A[j]`.
# 
# Given `N`, return **any** beautiful array `A`.  (It is guaranteed that one
# exists.)
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 4
#     Output: [2,1,4,3]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 5
#     Output: [3,1,2,5,4]
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * `1 <= N <= 1000`
