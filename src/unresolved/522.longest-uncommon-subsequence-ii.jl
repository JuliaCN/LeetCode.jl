# 
# Given a list of strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence
# among them. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest
# subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be **any**
# subsequence of the other strings.
# 
# A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by
# deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements.
# Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a
# subsequence of any string.
# 
# The input will be a list of strings, and the output needs to be the length of
# the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't
# exist, return -1.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "aba", "cdc", "eae"
#     Output: 3
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. All the given strings' lengths will not exceed 10.
#   2. The length of the given list will be in the range of [2, 50].
