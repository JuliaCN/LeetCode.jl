# 
# Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them
# **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) **so that
# objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red,
# white, and blue.
# 
# Here, we will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red,
# white, and blue respectively.
# 
# **Follow up:**
# 
#   * Could you solve this problem without using the library's sort function?
#   * Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only `O(1)` constant space?
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
#     Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [2,0,1]
#     Output: [0,1,2]
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [0]
#     Output: [0]
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1]
#     Output: [1]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `n == nums.length`
#   * `1 <= n <= 300`
#   * `nums[i]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.
