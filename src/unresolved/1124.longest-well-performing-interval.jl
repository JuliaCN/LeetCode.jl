# 
# We are given `hours`, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given
# employee.
# 
# A day is considered to be a _tiring day_ if and only if the number of hours
# worked is (strictly) greater than `8`.
# 
# A _well-performing interval_ is an interval of days for which the number of
# tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.
# 
# Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= hours.length <= 10000`
#   * `0 <= hours[i] <= 16`
