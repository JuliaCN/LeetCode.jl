# 
# There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0`
# to `numCourses-1`.
# 
# Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
# first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
# 
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs** , is it
# possible for you to finish all courses?
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
#     Output: true
#     Explanation:  There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
#                  To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
#     Output: false
#     Explanation:  There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
#                  To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
#                  also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges** , not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
#   * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
#   * `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`
