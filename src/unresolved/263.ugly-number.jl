# 
# Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
# 
# Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3,
# 5`.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 6
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 8
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 14
#     Output: false 
#     Explanation:14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
#   2. Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].
