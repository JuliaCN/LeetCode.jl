# 
# Given two arrays of length `m` and `n` with digits `0-9` representing two
# numbers. Create the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` from digits of the
# two. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved.
# Return an array of the `k` digits.
# 
# **Note:** You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 5]
#     nums2 = [9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]
#     k = 5
#     Output:
#     [9, 8, 6, 5, 3]
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     nums1 = [6, 7]
#     nums2 = [6, 0, 4]
#     k = 5
#     Output:
#     [6, 7, 6, 0, 4]
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     nums1 = [3, 9]
#     nums2 = [8, 9]
#     k = 3
#     Output:
#     [9, 8, 9]
