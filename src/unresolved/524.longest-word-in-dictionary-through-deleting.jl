# 
# Given a string and a string dictionary, find the longest string in the
# dictionary that can be formed by deleting some characters of the given string.
# If there are more than one possible results, return the longest word with the
# smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the
# empty string.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     s = "abpcplea", d = ["ale","apple","monkey","plea"]
#     
#     Output: 
#     "apple"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     s = "abpcplea", d = ["a","b","c"]
#     
#     Output: 
#     "a"
#     
# 
# **Note:**  
# 
#   1. All the strings in the input will only contain lower-case letters.
#   2. The size of the dictionary won't exceed 1,000.
#   3. The length of all the strings in the input won't exceed 1,000.
