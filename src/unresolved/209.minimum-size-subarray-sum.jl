# 
# Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s** , find
# the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum ≥ **s**. If
# there isn't one, return 0 instead.
# 
# **Example:  **
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
#     Output: 2
#     Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
# 
# **Follow up:**
# 
# If you have figured out the _O_ ( _n_ ) solution, try coding another solution
# of which the time complexity is _O_ ( _n_ log _n_ ).
