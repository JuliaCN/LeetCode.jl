# 
# Return the root node of a binary **search** tree that matches the given
# `preorder` traversal.
# 
# _(Recall that a binary search tree  is a binary tree where for every node, any
# descendant of `node.left` has a value `<` `node.val`, and any descendant of
# `node.right` has a value `>` `node.val`.  Also recall that a preorder
# traversal displays the value of the `node` first, then traverses `node.left`,
# then traverses `node.right`.)_
# 
# It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find
# a binary search tree with the given requirements.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
#     Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= preorder.length <= 100`
#   * `1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8`
#   * The values of `preorder` are distinct.
