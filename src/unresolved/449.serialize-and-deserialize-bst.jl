# Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits
# so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a
# network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another
# computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**.
# There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm
# should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to
# a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# **The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [2,1,3]
#     Output: [2,1,3]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = []
#     Output: []
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
#   * `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
#   * The input tree is **guaranteed** to be a binary search tree.
