# 
# Given a table `salary`, such as the one below, that has m=male and f=female
# values. Swap all f and m values (i.e., change all f values to m and vice
# versa) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temp table.
# 
# Note that you must write a single update statement, **DO NOT** write any
# select statement for this problem.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     | id | name | sex | salary |
#     |----|------|-----|--------|
#     | 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
#     | 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
#     | 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
#     | 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
#     
# 
# After running your **update** statement, the above salary table should have
# the following rows:
# 
#     
#     
#     | id | name | sex | salary |
#     |----|------|-----|--------|
#     | 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
#     | 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
#     | 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
#     | 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
#     
#
