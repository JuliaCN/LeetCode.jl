# 
# A _self-dividing number_ is a number that is divisible by every digit it
# contains.
# 
# For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 ==
# 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.
# 
# Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
# 
# Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self
# dividing number, including the bounds if possible.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 
#     left = 1, right = 22
#     Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
# * The boundaries of each input argument are `1 <= left <= right <= 10000`.
