# Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the _count of odd
# numbers between_`low` _and_` high` _  (inclusive)_.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: low = 3, high = 7
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: low = 8, high = 10
#     Output: 1
#     Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `0 <= low <= high <= 10^9`
