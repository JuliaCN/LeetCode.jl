# 
# Given scores of **N** athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with
# the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal",
# "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
#     Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
#     Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".   
#     For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
#     
# 
# **Note:**  
# 
#   1. N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
#   2. All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.
