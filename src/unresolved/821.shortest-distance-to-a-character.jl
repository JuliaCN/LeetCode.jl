# 
# Given a string `S` and a character `C`, return an array of integers
# representing the shortest distance from the character `C` in the string.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
#     Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `S` string length is in `[1, 10000].`
#   2. `C` is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string `S`.
#   3. All letters in `S` and `C` are lowercase.
