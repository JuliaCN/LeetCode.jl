# Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters
# for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are
# less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k
# but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters
# and left the other as original.
# 
# **Example:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
#     Output: "bacdfeg"
#     
# 
# **Restrictions:** **
# 
#   1. The string consists of lower English letters only.
#   2. Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]
