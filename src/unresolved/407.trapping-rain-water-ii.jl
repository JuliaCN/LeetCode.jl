# 
# Given an `m x n` matrix of positive integers representing the height of each
# unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to
# trap after raining.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Given the following 3x6 height map:
#     [
#       [1,4,3,1,3,2],
#       [3,2,1,3,2,4],
#       [2,3,3,2,3,1]
#     ]
#     
#     Return 4.
#     
#

# 
# The above image represents the elevation map
# `[[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]` before the rain.
#

# 
# After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks. The total volume of water
# trapped is 4.
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= m, n <= 110`
#   * `0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 20000`
