# 
# Given string `S` and a dictionary of words `words`, find the number of
# `words[i]` that is a subsequence of `S`.
# 
#     
#     
#     **Example :**
#     Input: 
#     S = "abcde"
#     words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: There are three words in words that are a subsequence of S: "a", "acd", "ace".
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * All words in `words` and `S` will only consists of lowercase letters.
#   * The length of `S` will be in the range of `[1, 50000]`.
#   * The length of `words` will be in the range of `[1, 5000]`.
#   * The length of `words[i]` will be in the range of `[1, 50]`.
