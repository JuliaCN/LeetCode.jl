# 
# We are given two sentences `A` and `B`.  (A _sentence_  is a string of space
# separated words.  Each _word_ consists only of lowercase letters.)
# 
# A word is _uncommon_  if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and
# does not appear in the other sentence.
# 
# Return a list of all uncommon words.
# 
# You may return the list in any order.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
#     Output: ["sweet","sour"]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
#     Output: ["banana"]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `0 <= A.length <= 200`
#   2. `0 <= B.length <= 200`
#   3. `A` and `B` both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
