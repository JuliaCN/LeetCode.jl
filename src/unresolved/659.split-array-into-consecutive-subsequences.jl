# 
# Given an array `nums` sorted in ascending order, return `true` if and only if
# you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence
# consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
#     Output: True
#     Explanation:
#     You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
#     1, 2, 3
#     3, 4, 5
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
#     Output: True
#     Explanation:
#     You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
#     1, 2, 3, 4, 5
#     3, 4, 5
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
#     Output: False
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 10000`
#
