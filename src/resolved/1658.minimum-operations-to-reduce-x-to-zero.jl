# 
# You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation,
# you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array
# `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this **modifies** the array
# for future operations.
# 
# Return _the **minimum number** of operations to reduce _`x` _to **exactly**_
# `0` _if it 's possible_ _, otherwise, return_`-1`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
#     Output: 2
#     Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
#     Output: -1
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10
#     Output: 5
#     Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last three elements and the first two elements (5 operations in total) to reduce x to zero.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
#   * `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
#   * `1 <= x <= 109`
