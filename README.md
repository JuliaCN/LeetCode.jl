[中文说明](README-zh-cn.md)

A community driven project to provide solutions for LeetCode problems in the Julia programming language.

## How to contribute?

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this project.
2. Create a new problem file under the `src/problems/` folder. You may want to use tools like [leetcode-cli](https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli) with the command like `leetcode show 1 -g -x -l python` to generate a `python` template and then modify the code and rename it into a `.jl` file. (You may also consider [LeetCode VSCode Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) if you use VSCode)
3. Write test cases inside the `test/problems` folder to make sure the solutions work as expected.
4. For some common components, please put them into the `src/common.jl` file and add test cases in `test/common.jl`.
5. Run `pkg> test` locally to make sure test passes. The test will also format your codes.
6. Commit your changes and make a pull request.
7. You may also **WATCH** this project to help review other's PR or **STAR** this project to spread JuliaLang to others.
