    "\n",
    "Initially, the first character of the **ring** is aligned at 12:00 direction.\n",
    "You need to spell all the characters in the string **key** one by one by\n",
    "rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the\n",

    "  1. You can rotate the **ring** clockwise or anticlockwise **one place** , which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string **ring 's** characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character **key[i]**.\n",
    "  2. If the character **key[i]** has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.\n",

    "    Input: ring = \"godding\", key = \"gd\"\n",
    "    Output: 4\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character.\n",
    "    For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring \"godding\" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become \"ddinggo\".\n",
    "    Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.\n",
    "    So the final output is 4.\n",

    "  1. Length of both ring and **key** will be in range 1 to 100.\n",
    "  2. There are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.\n",
    "  3. It's guaranteed that string **key** could always be spelled by rotating the string **ring**."
