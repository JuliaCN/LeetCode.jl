    "    The two rabbits that answered \"1\" could both be the same color, say red.\n",
    "    The rabbit than answered \"2\" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.\n",
    "    Say the rabbit that answered \"2\" was blue.\n",
    "    Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.\n",
