    "Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum\n",

    "    Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.\n",

    "    The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:\n",

    "  1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and `100`.\n",
