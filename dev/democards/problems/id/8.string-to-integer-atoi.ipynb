    "Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until\n",
    "the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this\n",
    "character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many\n",
    "numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.\n",

    "If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid\n",
