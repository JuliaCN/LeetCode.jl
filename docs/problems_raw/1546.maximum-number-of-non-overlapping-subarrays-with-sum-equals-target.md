Given an array `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return the maximum number of **non-empty**   **non-overlapping** subarrays
such that the sum of values in each subarray is equal to `target`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 2    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: There are 2 non-overlapping subarrays [ **1,1** ,1, **1,1** ] with sum equals to target(2).    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,3,5,1,4,2,-9], target = 6    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: There are 3 subarrays with sum equal to 6.    ([5,1], [4,2], [3,5,1,4,2,-9]) but only the first 2 are non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [-2,6,6,3,5,4,1,2,8], target = 10    
	Output: 3    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 0    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  * `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
  * `0 <= target <= 10^6`


**Code:**
