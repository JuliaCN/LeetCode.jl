Given an array of strings `arr`. String `s` is a concatenation of a sub-
sequence of `arr` which have **unique characters**.

Return _the maximum possible length_ of `s`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: All possible concatenations are "","un","iq","ue","uniq" and "ique".    Maximum length is 4.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: Possible solutions are "chaers" and "acters".    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]    
	Output: 26    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 16`
  * `1 <= arr[i].length <= 26`
  * `arr[i]` contains only lower case English letters.


**Code:**
