Given a number `s` in their binary representation. Return the number of steps
to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

  * If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

  * If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It's guaranteed that you can always reach to one for all testcases.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: s = "1101"    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.    Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14.     Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.    Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.    Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.      Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2.     Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.      

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: s = "10"    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: "10" corressponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.    Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.      

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: s = "1"    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 500`
  * `s` consists of characters '0' or '1'
  * `s[0] == '1'`


**Code:**
