Given a string `s` which represents an expression, _evaluate this expression
and return its value_.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: s = "3+2*2"    
	Output: 7    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: s = " 3/2 "    
	Output: 1    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "    
	Output: 5    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
  * `s` consists of integers and operators `('+', '-', '*', '/')` separated by some number of spaces.
  * `s` represents **a valid expression**.
  * All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 231 - 1]`.
  * The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit integer**.


**Code:**
