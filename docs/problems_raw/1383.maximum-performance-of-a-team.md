There are `n` engineers numbered from 1 to `n` and two arrays: `speed` and
`efficiency`, where `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and
efficiency for the i-th engineer respectively. _Return the maximum
**performance** of a team composed of at most `k` engineers, since the answer
can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7._

The **performance** of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied
by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2    
	Output: 60    
	Explanation:     We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3    
	Output: 68    
	Explanation: This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4    
	Output: 72    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 10^5`
  * `speed.length == n`
  * `efficiency.length == n`
  * `1 <= speed[i] <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= efficiency[i] <= 10^8`
  * `1 <= k <= n`


**Code:**
