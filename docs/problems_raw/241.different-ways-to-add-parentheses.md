Given a string of numbers and operators, return all possible results from
computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators. The
valid operators are `+`, `-` and `*`.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: "2-1-1"    
	Output: [0, 2]    
	Explanation:    ((2-1)-1) = 0     (2-(1-1)) = 2

**Example 2:**
            
	Input:"2*3-4*5"    
	Output: [-34, -14, -10, -10, 10]    
	Explanation: (2*(3-(4*5))) = -34     ((2*3)-(4*5)) = -14     ((2*(3-4))*5) = -10     (2*((3-4)*5)) = -10     (((2*3)-4)*5) = 10 ****
