You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go
downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range
-1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**
            root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8              10         /  \        **5**   **-3**       **/** **\**    **\**      **3**   **2**   **11**     / \   **\**    3  -2   **1**        Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:        1.  5 -> 3    2.  5 -> 2 -> 1    3. -3 -> 11
