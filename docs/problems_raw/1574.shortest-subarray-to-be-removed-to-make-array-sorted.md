Given an integer array `arr`, remove a subarray (can be empty) from `arr` such
that the remaining elements in `arr` are **non-decreasing**.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Return  _the length of the shortest subarray to remove_.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.    Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,2,3]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any elements.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: arr = [1]    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
  * `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`


**Code:**
