Given an array `A` of integers, a _ramp_  is a tuple `(i, j)` for which `i <
j` and `A[i] <= A[j]`.  The width of such a ramp is `j - i`.

Find the maximum width of a ramp in `A`.  If one doesn't exist, return 0.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [6,0,8,2,1,5]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation:    The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]    
	Output: 7    
	Explanation:    The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.    



**Note:**

  1. `2 <= A.length <= 50000`
  2. `0 <= A[i] <= 50000`




**Code:**
