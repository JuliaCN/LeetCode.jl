Given a 2D matrix _matrix_ , find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle
defined by its upper left corner ( _row_ 1, _col_ 1) and lower right corner (
_row_ 2, _col_ 2).

![Range Sum Query 2D](/static/images/courses/range_sum_query_2d.png)  
The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = **(2,
1)** and (row2, col2) = **(4, 3)** , which contains sum = **8**.

**Example:**  
            Given matrix = [      [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],      [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],      [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],      [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],      [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]    ]        sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8    sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2) -> 11    sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4) -> 12    

**Note:**  

  1. You may assume that the matrix does not change.
  2. There are many calls to _sumRegion_ function.
  3. You may assume that _row_ 1 ≤ _row_ 2 and _col_ 1 ≤ _col_ 2.


**Code:**
