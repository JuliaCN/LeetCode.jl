Given a string S, find the number of different non-empty palindromic
subsequences in S, and **return that number modulo`10^9 + 7`.**

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from
S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is
some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.

**Example 1:**  
            
	Input:     S = 'bccb'    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation:     The 6 different non-empty palindromic subsequences are 'b', 'c', 'bb', 'cc', 'bcb', 'bccb'.    Note that 'bcb' is counted only once, even though it occurs twice.    

**Example 2:**  
            
	Input:     S = 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcddcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcbadcba'    
	Output: 104860361    
	Explanation:     There are 3104860382 different non-empty palindromic subsequences, which is 104860361 modulo 10^9 + 7.    

**Note:**

* The length of `S` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* Each character `S[i]` will be in the set `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}`.
