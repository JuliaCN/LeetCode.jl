Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.

Return the number of **non-empty** subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of
the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to `target`. Since the
answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.    [3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)    [3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)    [3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)    [3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).    [3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12    
	Output: 61    
	Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them don't satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).    Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: nums = [5,2,4,1,7,6,8], target = 16    
	Output: 127    
	Explanation: All non-empty subset satisfy the condition (2^7 - 1) = 127



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
  * `1 <= target <= 106`
