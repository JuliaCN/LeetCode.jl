Say you have an array `prices` for which the _i_ th element is the price of a
given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock
multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e.,
you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]    
	Output: 7    
	Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.                 Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [1,2,3,4,5]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.                 Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are                 engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: [7,6,4,3,1]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4`


**Code:**
