Suppose that a website contains two tables, the `Customers` table and the
`Orders` table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order
anything.

Table: `Customers`.
            +----+-------+    | Id | Name  |    +----+-------+    | 1  | Joe   |    | 2  | Henry |    | 3  | Sam   |    | 4  | Max   |    +----+-------+    

Table: `Orders`.
            +----+------------+    | Id | CustomerId |    +----+------------+    | 1  | 3          |    | 2  | 1          |    +----+------------+    

Using the above tables as example, return the following:
            +-----------+    | Customers |    +-----------+    | Henry     |    | Max       |    +-----------+
