Given an integer array of `digits`, return the largest multiple of **three**
that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in any order.

Since the answer may not fit in an integer data type, return the answer as a
string.

If there is no answer return an empty string.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: digits = [8,1,9]    
	Output: "981"    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: digits = [8,6,7,1,0]    
	Output: "8760"    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: digits = [1]    
	Output: ""    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: digits = [0,0,0,0,0,0]    
	Output: "0"    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= digits.length <= 10^4`
  * `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`
  * The returning answer must not contain unnecessary leading zeros.


**Code:**
