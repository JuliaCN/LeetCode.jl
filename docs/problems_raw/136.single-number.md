Given a **non-empty**  array of integers `nums`, every element appears _twice_
except for one. Find that single one.

**Follow up:**  Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime
complexity and without using extra memory?



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,2,1]    
	Output: 1    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]    
	Output: 4    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [1]    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
  * Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.


**Code:**
