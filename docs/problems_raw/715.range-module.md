A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to
design and implement the following interfaces in an efficient manner.

* `addRange(int left, int right)` Adds the half-open interval `[left, right)`, tracking every real number in that interval. Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval `[left, right)` that are not already tracked.

* `queryRange(int left, int right)` Returns true if and only if every real number in the interval `[left, right)` is currently being tracked.

* `removeRange(int left, int right)` Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the interval `[left, right)`.

**Example 1:**  
            **addRange(10, 20)** : null    **removeRange(14, 16)** : null    **queryRange(10, 14)** : true (Every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)    **queryRange(13, 15)** : false (Numbers like 14, 14.03, 14.17 in [13, 15) are not being tracked)    **queryRange(16, 17)** : true (The number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked, despite the remove operation)    

**Note:**

* A half open interval `[left, right)` denotes all real numbers `left <= x < right`.
* `0 < left < right < 10^9` in all calls to `addRange, queryRange, removeRange`.
* The total number of calls to `addRange` in a single test case is at most `1000`.
* The total number of calls to `queryRange` in a single test case is at most `5000`.
* The total number of calls to `removeRange` in a single test case is at most `1000`.
