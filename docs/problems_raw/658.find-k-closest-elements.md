Given a **sorted** integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, return the
`k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in
ascending order.

An integer `a` is closer to `x` than an integer `b` if:

  * `|a - x| < |b - x|`, or
  * `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3    
	Output: [1,2,3,4]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1    
	Output: [1,2,3,4]    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= arr.length`
  * `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
  * Absolute value of elements in the array and `x` will not exceed `104`


**Code:**
