In English, we have a concept called **root** , which can be followed by some
other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **successor**.
For example, when the **root** `"an"` is followed by the **successor**  word
`"other"`, we can form a new word `"another"`.

Given a `dictionary` consisting of many **roots** and a `sentence` consisting
of words separated by spaces, replace all the **successors** in the sentence
with the **root** forming it. If a **successor** can be replaced by more than
one **root** , replace it with the **root** that has  **the shortest length**.

Return _the`sentence`_ after the replacement.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"    
	Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"    
	Output: "a a b c"    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"], sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"    
	Output: "a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: dictionary = ["catt","cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"    
	Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: dictionary = ["ac","ab"], sentence = "it is abnormal that this solution is accepted"    
	Output: "it is ab that this solution is ac"    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100`
  * `dictionary[i]` consists of only lower-case letters.
  * `1 <= sentence.length <= 10^6`
  * `sentence` consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
  * The number of words in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
  * The length of each word in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
  * Each two consecutive words in `sentence` will be separated by exactly one space.
  * `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.
