Given an array of integers `A`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `A`.

For any sequence S, let the  _width_  of S be the difference between the
maximum and minimum element of S.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of A.

As the answer may be very large, **return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [2,1,3]    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [2,1], [2,3], [1,3], [2,1,3].    The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.    The sum of these widths is 6.    



**Note:**

  * `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
  * `1 <= A[i] <= 20000`


**Code:**
