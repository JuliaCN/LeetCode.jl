_Special_ binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

* The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
* Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

Given a special string `S`, a _move_ consists of choosing two consecutive,
non-empty, special substrings of `S`, and swapping them. _(Two strings are
consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index
before the first character of the second string.)_

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest
resulting string possible?

**Example 1:**  
            
	Input: S = "11011000"    
	Output: "11100100"    
	Explanation:    The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.    This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.    

**Note:**

  1. `S` has length at most `50`.
  2. `S` is guaranteed to be a _special_ binary string as defined above.


**Code:**
