Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]    
	Output: [2,2]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]    
	Output: [4,9]

**Note:**

  * Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
  * The result can be in any order.

**Follow up:**

  * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
  * What if _nums1_ 's size is small compared to _nums2_ 's size? Which algorithm is better?
  * What if elements of _nums2_ are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?


**Code:**
