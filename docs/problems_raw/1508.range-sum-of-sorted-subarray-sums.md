Given the array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers. You computed the
sum of all non-empty continous subarrays from the array and then sort them in
non-decreasing order, creating a new array of `n * (n + 1) / 2` numbers.

_Return the sum of the numbers from index_`left` _to index_`right` ( **indexed
from 1** ) _, inclusive, in the  new array. _Since the answer can be a huge
number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5    
	Output: 13     
	Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13.     

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10    
	Output: 50    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
  * `nums.length == n`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
  * `1 <= left <= right <= n * (n + 1) / 2`


**Code:**
