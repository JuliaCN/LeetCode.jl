A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the
following mapping way:
            'A' -> 1    'B' -> 2    ...    'Z' -> 26    

Beyond that, now the encoded string can also contain the character '*', which
can be treated as one of the numbers from 1 to 9.

Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the
total number of ways to decode it.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109
\+ 7.

**Example 1:**  
            
	Input: "*"    
	Output: 9    
	Explanation: The encoded message can be decoded to the string: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I".    

**Example 2:**  
            
	Input: "1*"    
	Output: 9 + 9 = 18    

**Note:**  

  1. The length of the input string will fit in range [1, 105].
  2. The input string will only contain the character '*' and digits '0' - '9'.


**Code:**
