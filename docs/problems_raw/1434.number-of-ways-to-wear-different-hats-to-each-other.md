There are `n` people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40.

Given a list of list of integers `hats`, where `hats[i]` is a list of all hats
preferred by the `i-th` person.

Return the number of ways that the n people wear different hats to each other.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: There is only one way to choose hats given the conditions.     First person choose hat 3, Second person choose hat 4 and last one hat 5.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: hats = [[3,5,1],[3,5]]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: There are 4 ways to choose hats    (3,5), (5,3), (1,3) and (1,5)    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: hats = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]]    
	Output: 24    
	Explanation: Each person can choose hats labeled from 1 to 4.    Number of Permutations of (1,2,3,4) = 24.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: hats = [[1,2,3],[2,3,5,6],[1,3,7,9],[1,8,9],[2,5,7]]    
	Output: 111    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == hats.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 10`
  * `1 <= hats[i].length <= 40`
  * `1 <= hats[i][j] <= 40`
  * `hats[i]` contains a list of **unique** integers.
