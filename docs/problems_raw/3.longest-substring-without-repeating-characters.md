**Difficulty:** Medium
Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without
repeating characters.



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = "abcabcbb"    Output: 3    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = "bbbbb"    Output: 1    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: s = "pwwkew"    Output: 3    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.    

**Example 4:**
            Input: s = ""    Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


**Idea:**

**Code:**
