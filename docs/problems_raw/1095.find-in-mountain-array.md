_(This problem is an   **interactive problem**.)_

You may recall that an array `A` is a _mountain array_ if and only if:

  * `A.length >= 3`
  * There exists some `i` with `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that:     * `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]`    * `A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the **minimum**  `index` such
that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`.  If such an `index` doesn't exist,
return `-1`.

**You can 't access the mountain array directly.**  You may only access the
array using a `MountainArray` interface:

  * `MountainArray.get(k)` returns the element of the array at index `k` (0-indexed).
  * `MountainArray.length()` returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than `100` calls to `MountainArray.get` will be judged
_Wrong Answer_.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will
result in disqualification.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: array = [1,2,3,4,5,3,1], target = 3    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: 3 exists in the array, at index=2 and index=5. Return the minimum index, which is 2.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: array = [0,1,2,4,2,1], target = 3    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: 3 does not exist in the array, so we return -1.    



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= mountain_arr.length() <= 10000`
  * `0 <= target <= 10^9`
  * `0 <= mountain_arr.get(index) <= 10^9`


**Code:**
