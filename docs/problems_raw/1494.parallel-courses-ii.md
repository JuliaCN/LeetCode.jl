Given the integer `n` representing the number of courses at some university
labeled from `1` to `n`, and the array `dependencies` where `dependencies[i] =
[xi, yi]`  represents a prerequisite relationship, that is, the course `xi`
must be taken before the course `yi`.  Also, you are given the integer `k`.

In one semester you can take **at most** `k` courses as long as you have taken
all the prerequisites for the courses you are taking.

_Return the minimum number of semesters to take all courses_. It is guaranteed
that you can take all courses in some way.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/22/leetcode_parallel_courses_1.png)**
            
	Input: n = 4, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[1,4]], k = 2    
	Output: 3     
	Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph. In this case we can take courses 2 and 3 in the first semester, then take course 1 in the second semester and finally take course 4 in the third semester.    

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/22/leetcode_parallel_courses_2.png)**
            
	Input: n = 5, dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[4,1],[1,5]], k = 2    
	Output: 4     
	Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph. In this case one optimal way to take all courses is: take courses 2 and 3 in the first semester and take course 4 in the second semester, then take course 1 in the third semester and finally take course 5 in the fourth semester.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: n = 11, dependencies = [], k = 2    
	Output: 6    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 15`
  * `1 <= k <= n`
  * `0 <= dependencies.length <= n * (n-1) / 2`
  * `dependencies[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= xi, yi <= n`
  * `xi != yi`
  * All prerequisite relationships are distinct, that is, `dependencies[i] != dependencies[j]`.
  * The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.


**Code:**
