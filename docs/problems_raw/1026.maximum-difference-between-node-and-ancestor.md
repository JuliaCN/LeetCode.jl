Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `V` for which there
exist **different** nodes `A` and `B` where `V = |A.val - B.val|` and `A` is
an ancestor of `B`.

A node `A` is an ancestor of `B` if either: any child of `A` is equal to `B`,
or any child of `A` is an ancestor of `B`.



**Example 1:**

	Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]    
	Output: 7    
	Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :    |8 - 3| = 5    |3 - 7| = 4    |8 - 1| = 7    |10 - 13| = 3    Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.

**Example 2:**

	Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 5000]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 105`


**Code:**
