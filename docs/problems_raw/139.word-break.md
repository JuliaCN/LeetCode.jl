Given a **non-empty** string _s_ and a dictionary _wordDict_ containing a list
of **non-empty** words, determine if _s_ can be segmented into a space-
separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note:**

  * The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
  * You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]    
	Output: true    
	Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]    
	Output: true    
	Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".                 Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]    
	Output: false    


**Code:**
