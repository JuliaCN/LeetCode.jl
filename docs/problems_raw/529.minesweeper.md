Let's play the minesweeper game
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_\(video_game\)),
[online game](http://minesweeperonline.com))!

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. **' M'**
represents an **unrevealed** mine, **' E'** represents an **unrevealed** empty
square, **' B'** represents a **revealed** blank square that has no adjacent
(above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, **digit** ('1' to '8')
represents how many mines are adjacent to this **revealed** square, and
finally **' X'** represents a **revealed** mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the
**unrevealed** squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this
position according to the following rules:

  1. If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to **' X'**.
  2. If an empty square ('E') with **no adjacent mines** is revealed, then change it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent **unrevealed** squares should be revealed recursively.
  3. If an empty square ('E') with **at least one adjacent mine** is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
  4. Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input:         [['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],     ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],     ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],     ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']]        Click : [3,0]        
	Output:         [['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],     ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],     ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],     ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

**Example 2:**
            
	Input:         [['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],     ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],     ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],     ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]        Click : [1,2]        
	Output:         [['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],     ['B', '1', 'X', '1', 'B'],     ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],     ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

**Note:**

  1. The range of the input matrix's height and width is [1,50].
  2. The click position will only be an unrevealed square ('M' or 'E'), which also means the input board contains at least one clickable square.
  3. The input board won't be a stage when game is over (some mines have been revealed).
  4. For simplicity, not mentioned rules should be ignored in this problem. For example, you **don 't** need to reveal all the unrevealed mines when the game is over, consider any cases that you will win the game or flag any squares.
