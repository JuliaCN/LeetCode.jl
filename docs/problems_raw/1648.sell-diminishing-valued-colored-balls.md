You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer
that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is
the number of balls **of that color  **you currently have in your `inventory`.
For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the
first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls
left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the
balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents
the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also
given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the
customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.

Return _the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling
_`orders` _colored balls_. As the answer may be too large, return it
**modulo**`109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/jj.gif)
            
	Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4    
	Output: 14    
	Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).    The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: inventory = [3,5], orders = 6    
	Output: 19    
	Explanation: Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).    The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20    
	Output: 110    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000    
	Output: 21    
	Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of 500000000500000000. 500000000500000000 modulo 109 + 7 = 21.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= inventory.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= inventory[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 109)`


**Code:**
