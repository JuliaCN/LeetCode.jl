You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of `time[i]`
seconds.

Return _the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds
is divisible by_ `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such
that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:    (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180    (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120    (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: time = [60,60,60]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104`
  * `1 <= time[i] <= 500`


**Code:**
