Given an array of integers that is already **_sorted in ascending order_** ,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they
add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

  * Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
  * You may assume that each input would have _exactly_ one solution and you may not use the _same_ element twice.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9    
	Output: [1,2]    
	Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6    
	Output: [1,3]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1    
	Output: [1,2]    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
  * `nums` is sorted in **increasing order**.
  * `-1000 <= target <= 1000`


**Code:**
