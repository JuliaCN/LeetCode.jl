Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between
variables, each string `equations[i]` has length `4` and takes one of two
different forms: `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`.  Here, `a` and `b` are lowercase
letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable
names so as to satisfy all the given equations.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: ["a==b","b!=a"]    
	Output: false    
	Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: ["b==a","a==b"]    
	Output: true    
	Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]    
	Output: true    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]    
	Output: false    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]    
	Output: true    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= equations.length <= 500`
  2. `equations[i].length == 4`
  3. `equations[i][0]` and `equations[i][3]` are lowercase letters
  4. `equations[i][1]` is either `'='` or `'!'`
  5. `equations[i][2]` is `'='`
