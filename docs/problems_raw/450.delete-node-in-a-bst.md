Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given
key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

  1. Search for a node to remove.
  2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Follow up:**  Can you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)
            
	Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3    
	Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]    
	Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.    One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.    Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_supp.jpg)    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0    
	Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]    
	Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: root = [], key = 0    
	Output: []    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
  * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
  * Each node has a **unique** value.
  * `root` is a valid binary search tree.
  * `-105 <= key <= 105`


**Code:**
