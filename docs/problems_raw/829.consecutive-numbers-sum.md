Given a positive integer `N`, how many ways can we write it as a sum of
consecutive positive integers?

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: 5    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: 9    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: 15    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

**Note:**  `1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9`.
