You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers locations where
`locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given
integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending
city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that `j
!= i` and `0 <= j < locations.length` and move to city `j`. Moving from city
`i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] -
locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel`  **cannot** become negative at any point in time, and that
you are **allowed** to visit any city more than once (including `start` and
`finish`).

Return _the count of all possible routes from  _`start`  _to_  `finish`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation:  The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:    1 -> 3    1 -> 2 -> 3    1 -> 4 -> 3    1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6    
	Output: 5    
	Explanation: The following are all possible routes:    1 -> 0, used fuel = 1    1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5    1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5    1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3    1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: It's impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: locations = [2,1,5], start = 0, finish = 0, fuel = 3    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation:  There are two possible routes, 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 0.

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: locations = [1,2,3], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 40    
	Output: 615088286    
	Explanation: The total number of possible routes is 2615088300. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 615088286.    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= locations.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= locations[i] <= 10^9`
  * All integers in `locations` are  **distinct**.
  * `0 <= start, finish < locations.length`
  * `1 <= fuel <= 200`


**Code:**
