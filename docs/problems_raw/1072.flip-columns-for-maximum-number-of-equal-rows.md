Given a `matrix` consisting of 0s and 1s, we may choose any number of columns
in the matrix and flip **every**  cell in that column.  Flipping a cell
changes the value of that cell from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number
of flips.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [[0,1],[1,1]]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= matrix.length <= 300`
  2. `1 <= matrix[i].length <= 300`
  3. All `matrix[i].length`'s are equal
  4. `matrix[i][j]` is `0` or `1`


**Code:**
