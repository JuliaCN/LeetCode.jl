Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new **sorted** list. The new
list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)
            
	Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]    
	Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: l1 = [], l2 = []    
	Output: []    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]    
	Output: [0]    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
  * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
  * Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.


**Code:**
