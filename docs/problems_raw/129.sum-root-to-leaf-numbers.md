Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path
could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number
`123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

**Note:**  A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**
            
	Input: [1,2,3]        1       / \      2   3    
	Output: 25    
	Explanation:    The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.    The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.    Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [4,9,0,5,1]        4       / \      9   0     / \    5   1    
	Output: 1026    
	Explanation:    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.    The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.    The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.    Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
