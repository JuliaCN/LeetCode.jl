There are a total of `n` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have direct prerequisites, for example, to take course 0 you
have first to take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[1,0]`

Given the total number of courses `n`, a list of direct `prerequisite`
**pairs** and a list of `queries` **pairs**.

You should answer for each `queries[i]` whether the course `queries[i][0]` is
a prerequisite of the course `queries[i][1]` or not.

Return _a list of boolean_ , the answers to the given `queries`.

Please note that if course **a** is a prerequisite of course **b** and course
**b** is a prerequisite of course **c** , then, course **a** is a prerequisite
of course **c**.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/17/graph.png)
            
	Input: n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]    
	Output: [false,true]    
	Explanation: course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1 but the opposite is true.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]    
	Output: [false,false]    
	Explanation: There are no prerequisites and each course is independent.    

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/17/graph-1.png)
            
	Input: n = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]    
	Output: [true,true]    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: n = 3, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[0,1],[2,0]]    
	Output: [false,true]    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: n = 5, prerequisites = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], queries = [[0,4],[4,0],[1,3],[3,0]]    
	Output: [true,false,true,false]    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 100`
  * `0 <= prerequisite.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `0 <= prerequisite[i][0], prerequisite[i][1] < n`
  * `prerequisite[i][0] != prerequisite[i][1]`
  * The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
  * The prerequisites graph has no repeated edges.
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
  * `queries[i][0] != queries[i][1]`


**Code:**
