There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls.  Except
for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining
corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p`, and a laser ray from the southwest
corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0`th receptor.

Return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.  (It is guaranteed
that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.)



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: p = 2, q = 1    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.    ![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/18/reflection.png)    

**Note:**

  1. `1 <= p <= 1000`
  2. `0 <= q <= p`


**Code:**
