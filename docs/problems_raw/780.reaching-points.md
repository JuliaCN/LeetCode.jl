A move consists of taking a point `(x, y)` and transforming it to either `(x,
x+y)` or `(x+y, y)`.

Given a starting point `(sx, sy)` and a target point `(tx, ty)`, return `True`
if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point `(sx, sy)` to
`(tx, ty)`. Otherwise, return `False`.
            **Examples:**    
	Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5    
	Output: True    
	Explanation:    One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:    (1, 1) -> (1, 2)    (1, 2) -> (3, 2)    (3, 2) -> (3, 5)        
	Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2    
	Output: False        
	Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1    
	Output: True        

**Note:**

  * `sx, sy, tx, ty` will all be integers in the range `[1, 10^9]`.
