Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even
nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value
in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space
complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input:1->2->3->4->5->NULL    
	Output:1->3->5->2->4->NULL    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL    
	Output:2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL    



**Constraints:**

  * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
  * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
  * The length of the linked list is between `[0, 10^4]`.


**Code:**
