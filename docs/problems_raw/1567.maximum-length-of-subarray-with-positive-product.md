Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where
the product of all its elements is positive.

A subarray of an array is a consecutive sequence of zero or more values taken
out of that array.

Return  _the maximum length of a subarray with positive product_.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: The array nums already has a positive product of 24.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [1,-2,-3] which has a product of 6.    Notice that we cannot include 0 in the subarray since that'll make the product 0 which is not positive.

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,0,1]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: The longest subarray with positive product is [-1,-2] or [-2,-3].    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,2]    
	Output: 1    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,-6,4,0,10]    
	Output: 4    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  * `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`


**Code:**
