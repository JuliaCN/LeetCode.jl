In a N x N `grid` composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a
`/`, `\`, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous
regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `\` is represented as
`"\\"`.)

Return the number of regions.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [      " /",      "/ "    ]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/1.png)    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [      " /",      "  "    ]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/2.png)    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: [      "\\/",      "/\\"    ]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)    The 2x2 grid is as follows:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/3.png)    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: [      "/\\",      "\\/"    ]    
	Output: 5    
	Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)    The 2x2 grid is as follows:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/4.png)    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: [      "//",      "/ "    ]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/5.png)    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30`
  2. `grid[i][j]` is either `'/'`, `'\'`, or `' '`.
