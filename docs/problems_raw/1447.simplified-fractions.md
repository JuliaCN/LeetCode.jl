Given an integer `n`, return a list of all **simplified** fractions between 0
and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to `n`. The
fractions can be in **any** order.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 2    
	Output: ["1/2"]    
	Explanation: "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 3    
	Output: ["1/2","1/3","2/3"]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: n = 4    
	Output: ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"]    
	Explanation: "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2".

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: n = 1    
	Output: []    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 100`


**Code:**
