Given an `m x n` 2d `grid` map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return
_the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent
lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid
are all surrounded by water.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: grid = [      ["1","1","1","1","0"],      ["1","1","0","1","0"],      ["1","1","0","0","0"],      ["0","0","0","0","0"]    ]    
	Output: 1    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: grid = [      ["1","1","0","0","0"],      ["1","1","0","0","0"],      ["0","0","1","0","0"],      ["0","0","0","1","1"]    ]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == grid.length`
  * `n == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
  * `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.


**Code:**
