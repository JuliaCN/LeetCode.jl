A `3 x 3` magic square is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers
**from**`1` **to**`9` such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have
the same sum.

Given a `row x col` `grid` of integers, how many `3 x 3` "magic square"
subgrids are there?  (Each subgrid is contiguous).



**Example 1:**

	Input: grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation:    The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/11/magic_valid.jpg)    while this one is not:    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/11/magic_invalid.jpg)    In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: grid = [[8]]    
	Output: 0    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: grid = [[4,4],[3,3]]    
	Output: 0    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: grid = [[4,7,8],[9,5,1],[2,3,6]]    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `row == grid.length`
  * `col == grid[i].length`
  * `1 <= row, col <= 10`
  * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`


**Code:**
