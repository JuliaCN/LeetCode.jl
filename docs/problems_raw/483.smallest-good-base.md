For an integer n, we call k>=2 a _**good base**_ of n, if all digits of n base
k are 1.

Now given a string representing n, you should return the smallest good base of
n in string format.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: "13"    
	Output: "3"    
	Explanation: 13 base 3 is 111.    



**Example 2:**
            
	Input: "4681"    
	Output: "8"    
	Explanation: 4681 base 8 is 11111.    



**Example 3:**
            
	Input: "1000000000000000000"    
	Output: "999999999999999999"    
	Explanation: 1000000000000000000 base 999999999999999999 is 11.    



**Note:**

  1. The range of n is [3, 10^18].
  2. The string representing n is always valid and will not have leading zeros.




**Code:**
