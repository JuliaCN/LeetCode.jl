An N x N `board` contains only `0`s and `1`s. In each move, you can swap any 2
rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard"
\- a board where no `0`s and no `1`s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task
is impossible, return -1.
            **Examples:**    
	Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation:    One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:        0110     1010     1010    0110 --> 1010 --> 0101    1001     0101     1010    1001     0101     0101        The first move swaps the first and second column.    The second move swaps the second and third row.            
	Input: board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation:    Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,    01    10        is also a valid chessboard.        
	Input: board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation:    No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.    

**Note:**

  * `board` will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range `[2, 30]`.
  * `board[i][j]` will be only `0`s or `1`s.
