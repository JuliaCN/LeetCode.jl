Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or
down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-
around is not allowed).

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums =     [      [9,9,4],      [6,6,8],      [2,1,1]    ]     
	Output: 4     
	Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums =     [      [3,4,5],      [3,2,6],      [2,2,1]    ]     
	Output: 4     
	Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
