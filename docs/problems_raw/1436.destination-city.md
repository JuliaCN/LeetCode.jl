You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi]` means
there exists a direct path going from `cityAi` to `cityBi`. _Return the
destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another
city._

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop,
therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]    
	Output: "Sao Paulo"     
	Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]    
	Output: "A"    
	Explanation: All possible trips are:     "D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".     "B" -> "C" -> "A".     "C" -> "A".     "A".     Clearly the destination city is "A".    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]    
	Output: "Z"    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= paths.length <= 100`
  * `paths[i].length == 2`
  * `1 <= cityAi.length, cityBi.length <= 10`
  * `cityAi != cityBi`
  * All strings consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.


**Code:**
