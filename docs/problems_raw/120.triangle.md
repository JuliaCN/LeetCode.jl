Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you
may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
            [         [ **2** ],        [ **3** ,4],       [6, **5** ,7],      [4, **1** ,8,3]    ]    

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is `11` (i.e., **2** \+ **3** \+ **5**
\+ **1** = 11).

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only _O_ ( _n_ ) extra space,
where _n_ is the total number of rows in the triangle.


**Code:**
