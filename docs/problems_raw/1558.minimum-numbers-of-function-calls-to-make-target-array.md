Your task is to form an integer array `nums` from an initial array of zeros
`arr` that is the same size as `nums`.

Return the minimum number of function calls to make `nums` from `arr`.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,5]    
	Output: 5    
	Explanation: Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).    Double all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).    Increment by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] -> **[1, 5]** (2 operations).    Total of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,2]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: Increment by 1 (both elements) [0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [1, 1] (2 operations).    Double all the elements: [1, 1] -> **[2, 2]** (1 operation).    Total of operations: 2 + 1 = 3.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [4,2,5]    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1] -> [2,0,2] -> [2,1,2] -> [4,2,4] -> **[4,2,5]** (nums).    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,2,2,4]    
	Output: 7    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]    
	Output: 8    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`


**Code:**
