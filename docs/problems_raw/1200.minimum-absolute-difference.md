Given an array of **distinct**  integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements
with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair
`[a, b]` follows

  * `a, b` are from `arr`
  * `a < b`
  * `b - a` equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]    
	Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]    
	Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]    
	Output: [[1,3]]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = [3,8,-10,23,19,-4,-14,27]    
	Output: [[-14,-10],[19,23],[23,27]]    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
  * `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`


**Code:**
