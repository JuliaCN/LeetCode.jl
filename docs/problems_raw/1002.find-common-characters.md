Given an array `A` of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list
of all characters that show up in all strings within the list **(including
duplicates)**.  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but
not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final
answer.

You may return the answer in any order.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: ["bella","label","roller"]    
	Output: ["e","l","l"]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]    
	Output: ["c","o"]    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
  2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
  3. `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter


**Code:**
