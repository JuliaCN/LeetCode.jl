Given a binary tree `root`. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by
removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are
maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/21/sample_1_1699.png)**
            
	Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]    
	Output: 110    
	Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)    

**Example 2:**

	Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]    
	Output: 90    
	Explanation:  Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]    
	Output: 1025    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: root = [1,1]    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * Each tree has at most `50000` nodes and at least `2` nodes.
  * Each node's value is between `[1, 10000]`.


**Code:**
