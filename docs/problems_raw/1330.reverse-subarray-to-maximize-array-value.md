You are given an integer array `nums`. The _value_ of this array is defined as
the sum of `|nums[i]-nums[i+1]|` for all `0 <= i < nums.length-1`.

You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. You
can perform this operation **only once**.

Find maximum possible value of the final array.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4]    
	Output: 10    
	Explanation: By reversing the subarray [3,1,5] the array becomes [2,5,1,3,4] whose value is 10.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,4,9,24,2,1,10]    
	Output: 68    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 3*10^4`
  * `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`


**Code:**
