Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add
exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`.  For
example, `"abc"` is a predecessor of `"abac"`.

A _word chain  _is a sequence of words `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_k]` with `k
>= 1`, where `word_1` is a predecessor of `word_2`, `word_2` is a predecessor
of `word_3`, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the
given list of `words`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]    
	Output: 4    **Explanation** : One of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]    
	Output: 5    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 16`
  * `words[i]` only consists of English lowercase letters.


**Code:**
