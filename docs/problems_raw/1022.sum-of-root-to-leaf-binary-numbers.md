You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or
`1`.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most
significant bit.  For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then
this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from
the root to that leaf.

Return _the sum of these numbers_. The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a
**32-bits** integer.



**Example 1:**

numbers.png)
            
	Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]    
	Output: 22    
	Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: root = [0]    
	Output: 0    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: root = [1]    
	Output: 1    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: root = [1,1]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  * `Node.val` is `0` or `1`.


**Code:**
