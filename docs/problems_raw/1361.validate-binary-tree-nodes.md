You have `n` binary tree nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where node `i` has
two children `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]`, return `true` if and only if
**all** the given nodes form **exactly one** valid binary tree.

If node `i` has no left child then `leftChild[i]` will equal `-1`, similarly
for the right child.

Note that the nodes have no values and that we only use the node numbers in
this problem.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/23/1503_ex1.png)**
            
	Input: n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,-1]    
	Output: true    

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/23/1503_ex2.png)**
            
	Input: n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,3,-1,-1]    
	Output: false    

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/23/1503_ex3.png)**
            
	Input: n = 2, leftChild = [1,0], rightChild = [-1,-1]    
	Output: false    

**Example 4:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/23/1503_ex4.png)**
            
	Input: n = 6, leftChild = [1,-1,-1,4,-1,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,5,-1,-1]    
	Output: false    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 10^4`
  * `leftChild.length == rightChild.length == n`
  * `-1 <= leftChild[i], rightChild[i] <= n - 1`


**Code:**
