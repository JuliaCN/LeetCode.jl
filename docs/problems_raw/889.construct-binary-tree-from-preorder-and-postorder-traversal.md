Return any binary tree that matches the given preorder and postorder
traversals.

Values in the traversals `pre` and `post` are distinct positive integers.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: pre = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], post = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]    
	Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]    



**Note:**

  * `1 <= pre.length == post.length <= 30`
  * `pre[]` and `post[]` are both permutations of `1, 2, ..., pre.length`.
  * It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there exists multiple answers, you can return any of them.


**Code:**
