Given a 2-dimensional `grid` of integers, each value in the grid represents
the color of the grid square at that location.

Two squares belong to the same _connected component_ if and only if they have
the same color and are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.

The  _border_ of a connected component is all the squares in the connected
component that are either 4-directionally adjacent to a square not in the
component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).

Given a square at location `(r0, c0)` in the grid and a `color`, color the
border of the connected component of that square with the given `color`, and
return the final `grid`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 0, color = 3    
	Output: [[3, 3], [3, 2]]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,2,2],[2,3,2]], r0 = 0, c0 = 1, color = 3    
	Output: [[1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 3]]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], r0 = 1, c0 = 1, color = 2    
	Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= grid.length <= 50`
  2. `1 <= grid[0].length <= 50`
  3. `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
  4. `0 <= r0 < grid.length`
  5. `0 <= c0 < grid[0].length`
  6. `1 <= color <= 1000`
