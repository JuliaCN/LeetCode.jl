Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a **strictly increasing
order** , and an integer `k`.

_Find the_`kth` _  positive integer that is missing from this array._



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5    
	Output: 9    
	Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
  * `1 <= k <= 1000`
  * `arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`


**Code:**
