Given an array of integers `arr`. Return _the number of sub-arrays_ with
**odd** sum.

As the answer may grow large, the answer  **must be**  computed modulo `10^9 +
7`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,3,5]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: All sub-arrays are [[1],[1,3],[1,3,5],[3],[3,5],[5]]    All sub-arrays sum are [1,4,9,3,8,5].    Odd sums are [1,9,3,5] so the answer is 4.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [2,4,6]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: All sub-arrays are [[2],[2,4],[2,4,6],[4],[4,6],[6]]    All sub-arrays sum are [2,6,12,4,10,6].    All sub-arrays have even sum and the answer is 0.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]    
	Output: 16    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: arr = [100,100,99,99]    
	Output: 4    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: arr = [7]    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= 100`


**Code:**
