There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, arranged in a row
from left to right. Initially all the bulbs are **turned off**.

Your task is to obtain the configuration represented by `target` where
`target[i]` is '1' if the i-th bulb is turned on and is '0' if it is turned
off.

You have a switch to flip the state of the bulb, a flip operation is defined
as follows:

  * Choose **any** bulb (index `i`) of your current configuration.
  * Flip each bulb from index `i` to `n-1`.

When any bulb is flipped it means that if it is 0 it changes to 1 and if it is
1 it changes to 0.

Return the **minimum** number of flips required to form `target`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: target = "10111"    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: Initial configuration "00000".    flip from the third bulb:  "00000" -> "00111"    flip from the first bulb:  "00111" -> "11000"    flip from the second bulb:  "11000" -> "10111"    We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: target = "101"    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: "000" -> "111" -> "100" -> "101".    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: target = "00000"    
	Output: 0    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: target = "001011101"    
	Output: 5    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= target.length <= 10^5`
  * `target[i] == '0'` or `target[i] == '1'`


**Code:**
