You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some
points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan
distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the
absolute value of `val`.

Return  _the minimum cost to make all points connected._ All points are
connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/d.png)
            
	Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]    
	Output: 20    
	Explanation:![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/c.png)    We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.    Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]    
	Output: 18    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: points = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[-1,1]]    
	Output: 4    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: points = [[-1000000,-1000000],[1000000,1000000]]    
	Output: 4000000    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: points = [[0,0]]    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
  * `-106 <= xi, yi <= 106`
  * All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.


**Code:**
