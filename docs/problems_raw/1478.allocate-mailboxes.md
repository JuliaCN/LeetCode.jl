Given the array `houses` and an integer `k`. where `houses[i]` is the location
of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate `k` mailboxes in the
street.

Return the **minimum** total distance between each house and its nearest
mailbox.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.



**Example 1:**

	Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3    
	Output: 5    
	Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.    Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5     

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_2_1816.png)**
            
	Input: houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2    
	Output: 9    
	Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.    Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: houses = [7,4,6,1], k = 1    
	Output: 8    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: houses = [3,6,14,10], k = 4    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == houses.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= houses[i] <= 10^4`
  * `1 <= k <= n`
  * Array `houses` contain unique integers.


**Code:**
