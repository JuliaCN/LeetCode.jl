Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when
it reads the same backward as forward.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: x = 121    
	Output: true    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: x = -121    
	Output: false    
	Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: x = 10    
	Output: false    
	Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: x = -101    
	Output: false    



**Constraints:**

  * `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`


**Code:**
