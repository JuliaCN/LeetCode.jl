Given a square grid of integers `arr`, a _falling path with non-zero shifts_
is a choice of exactly one element from each row of `arr`, such that no two
elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

Return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]    
	Output: 13    
	Explanation:    The possible falling paths are:    [1,5,9], [1,5,7], [1,6,7], [1,6,8],    [2,4,8], [2,4,9], [2,6,7], [2,6,8],    [3,4,8], [3,4,9], [3,5,7], [3,5,9]    The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,5,7], so the answer is 13.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length == arr[i].length <= 200`
  * `-99 <= arr[i][j] <= 99`


**Code:**
