A chef has collected data on the `satisfaction` level of his `n` dishes. Chef
can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

_Like-time coefficient_  of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that
dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level  i.e.
`time[i]`*`satisfaction[i]`

Return the maximum sum of  _Like-time coefficient_ that the chef can obtain
after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in **any** order and the chef can discard some dishes
to get this maximum value.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]    
	Output: 14    
	Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total _Like-time coefficient_ will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14). Each dish is prepared in one unit of time.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]    
	Output: 20    
	Explanation: Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20)    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: People don't like the dishes. No dish is prepared.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: satisfaction = [-2,5,-1,0,3,-3]    
	Output: 35    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == satisfaction.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 500`
  * `-10^3 <= satisfaction[i] <= 10^3`


**Code:**
