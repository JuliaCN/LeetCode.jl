Given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the string
"croak" from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same
time, so multiple "croak" are mixed.  _Return the minimum number of_ different
_frogs to finish all the croak in the given string._

A valid "croak" means a frog is printing 5 letters 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k'
**sequentially**. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak.
If the given string is not a combination of valid "croak" return -1.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcroak"    
	Output: 1     
	Explanation: One frog yelling "croak **"** twice.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: croakOfFrogs = "crcoakroak"    
	Output: 2     
	Explanation: The minimum number of frogs is two.     The first frog could yell " **cr** c **oak** roak".    The second frog could yell later "cr **c** oak **roak** ".    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcrook"    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: The given string is an invalid combination of "croak **"** from different frogs.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcroa"    
	Output: -1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= croakOfFrogs.length <= 10^5`
  * All characters in the string are: `'c'`, `'r'`, `'o'`, `'a'` or `'k'`.


**Code:**
