Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array
of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying
the input array  [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-
place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii
characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]    
	Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]    
	Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]    


**Code:**
