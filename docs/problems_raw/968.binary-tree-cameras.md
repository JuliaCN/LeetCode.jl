Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.

Each camera at a node can monitor **its parent, itself, and its immediate
children**.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the
tree.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)
            
	Input: [0,0,null,0,0]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)
            
	Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.    

  
**Note:**

  1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  2. **Every** node has value 0.


**Code:**
