You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m`
respectively.

Remove `list1`'s nodes from the `ath` node to the `bth` node, and put `list2`
in their place.

The blue edges and nodes in the following figure incidate the result:

_Build the result list and return its head._



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/merge_linked_list_ex1.png)
            
	Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]    
	Output: [0,1,2,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]    
	Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/merge_linked_list_ex2.png)
            
	Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]    
	Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]    
	Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.    



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= list1.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1`
  * `1 <= list2.length <= 104`


**Code:**
