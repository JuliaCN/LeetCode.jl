Given a list of sorted characters `letters` containing only lowercase letters,
and given a target letter `target`, find the smallest element in the list that
is larger than the given target.

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is `target = 'z'` and
`letters = ['a', 'b']`, the answer is `'a'`.

**Examples:**  
            
	Input:    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]    target = "a"    
	Output: "c"        
	Input:    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]    target = "c"    
	Output: "f"        
	Input:    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]    target = "d"    
	Output: "f"        
	Input:    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]    target = "g"    
	Output: "j"        
	Input:    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]    target = "j"    
	Output: "c"        
	Input:    letters = ["c", "f", "j"]    target = "k"    
	Output: "c"    

**Note:**  

  1. `letters` has a length in range `[2, 10000]`.
  2. `letters` consists of lowercase letters, and contains at least 2 unique letters.
  3. `target` is a lowercase letter.
