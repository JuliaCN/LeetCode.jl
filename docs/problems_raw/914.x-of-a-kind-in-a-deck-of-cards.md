In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return `true` if and only if you can choose `X >= 2` such that it is possible
to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

  * Each group has exactly `X` cards.
  * All the cards in each group have the same integer.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]    
	Output: true    **Explanation** : Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]    
	Output: false´    **Explanation** : No possible partition.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: deck = [1]    
	Output: false    **Explanation** : No possible partition.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: deck = [1,1]    
	Output: true    **Explanation** : Possible partition [1,1].    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: deck = [1,1,2,2,2,2]    
	Output: true    **Explanation** : Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2].    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= deck.length <= 10^4`
  * `0 <= deck[i] < 10^4`


**Code:**
