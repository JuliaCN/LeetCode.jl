Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of
the longest **non-empty** subarray such that the absolute difference between
any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit` _._



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4    
	Output: 2     
	Explanation: All subarrays are:     [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.    [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.     [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.    [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.    [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.    [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.    [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.    [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.    [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.    [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4.     Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5    
	Output: 4     
	Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
  * `0 <= limit <= 10^9`
