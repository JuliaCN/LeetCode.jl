Given a string array `words`, find the maximum value of `length(word[i]) *
length(word[j])` where the two words do not share common letters. You may
assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two
words exist, return 0.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]    
	Output:16     
	Explanation:The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]    
	Output:4     
	Explanation:The two words can be "ab", "cd".

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]    
	Output:0     
	Explanation:No such pair of words.    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= words.length <= 10^3`
  * `0 <= words[i].length <= 10^3`
  * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.


**Code:**
