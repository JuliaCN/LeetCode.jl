The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between
two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are
different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**  
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**
            
	Input: x = 1, y = 4        
	Output: 2        
	Explanation:    1   (0 0 0 1)    4   (0 1 0 0)           ↑   ↑        The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.    


**Code:**
