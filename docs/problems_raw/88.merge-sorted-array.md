Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_ , merge _nums2_ into
_nums1_ as one sorted array.

**Note:**

  * The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
  * You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is  **equal** to _m_ \+ _n_ ) to hold additional elements from _nums2_.

**Example:**
            
	Input:    nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3    nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3        
	Output:  [1,2,2,3,5,6]    



**Constraints:**

  * `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9`
  * `nums1.length == m + n`
  * `nums2.length == n`


**Code:**
