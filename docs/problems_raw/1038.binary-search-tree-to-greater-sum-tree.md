Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree
such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus
sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a _binary search tree_ is a tree that satisfies these
constraints:

  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys  **less than**  the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys  **greater than**  the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Note:** This question is the same as 538:

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/02/tree.png)
            
	Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]    
	Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: root = [0,null,1]    
	Output: [1,null,1]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: root = [1,0,2]    
	Output: [3,3,2]    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: root = [3,2,4,1]    
	Output: [7,9,4,10]    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
  * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
  * All the values in the tree are **unique**.
  * `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.


**Code:**
