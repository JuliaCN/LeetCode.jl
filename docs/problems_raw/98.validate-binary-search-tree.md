Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search
tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



**Example 1:**

	Input: root = [2,1,3]    
	Output: true    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)
            
	Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]    
	Output: false    
	Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
  * `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`


**Code:**
