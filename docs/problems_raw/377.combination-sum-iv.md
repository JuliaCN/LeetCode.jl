Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the
number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.

**Example:**
            _**nums**_ = [1, 2, 3]    _**target**_ = 4        The possible combination ways are:    (1, 1, 1, 1)    (1, 1, 2)    (1, 2, 1)    (1, 3)    (2, 1, 1)    (2, 2)    (3, 1)        Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.        Therefore the output is _**7**_.    



**Follow up:**  
What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?  
How does it change the problem?  
What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
