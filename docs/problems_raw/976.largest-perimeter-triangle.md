Given an array `A` of positive lengths, return the largest perimeter of a
triangle with **non-zero area** , formed from 3 of these lengths.

If it is impossible to form any triangle of non-zero area, return `0`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [2,1,2]    
	Output: 5    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [1,2,1]    
	Output: 0    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: [3,2,3,4]    
	Output: 10    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: [3,6,2,3]    
	Output: 8    



**Note:**

  1. `3 <= A.length <= 10000`
  2. `1 <= A[i] <= 10^6`


**Code:**
