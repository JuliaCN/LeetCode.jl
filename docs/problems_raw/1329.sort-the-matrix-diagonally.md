Given a `m * n` matrix `mat` of integers, sort it diagonally in ascending
order from the top-left to the bottom-right then return the sorted array.



**Example 1:**

	Input: mat = [[3,3,1,1],[2,2,1,2],[1,1,1,2]]    
	Output: [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,2],[1,2,3,3]]    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == mat.length`
  * `n == mat[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 100`
  * `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100`


**Code:**
