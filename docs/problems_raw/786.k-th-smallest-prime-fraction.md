A sorted list `A` contains 1, plus some number of primes.  Then, for every p <
q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.

What is the `K`-th smallest fraction considered?  Return your answer as an
array of ints, where `answer[0] = p` and `answer[1] = q`.
            **Examples:**    
	Input: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3    
	Output: [2, 5]    
	Explanation:    The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:    1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.    The third fraction is 2/5.        
	Input: A = [1, 7], K = 1    
	Output: [1, 7]    

**Note:**

  * `A` will have length between `2` and `2000`.
  * Each `A[i]` will be between `1` and `30000`.
  * `K` will be between `1` and `A.length * (A.length - 1) / 2`.
