Given an n-ary tree, return the _preorder_ traversal of its nodes' values.

_Nary-Tree input serialization  is represented in their level order traversal,
each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)._



**Follow up:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)
            
	Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]    
	Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
            
	Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]    
	Output: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]    



**Constraints:**

  * The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
  * The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`


**Code:**
