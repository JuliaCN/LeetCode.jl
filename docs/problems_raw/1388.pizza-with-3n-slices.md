There is a pizza with 3n slices of varying size, you and your friends will
take slices of pizza as follows:

  * You will pick **any** pizza slice.
  * Your friend Alice will pick next slice in anti clockwise direction of your pick. 
  * Your friend Bob will pick next slice in clockwise direction of your pick.
  * Repeat until there are no more slices of pizzas.

Sizes of Pizza slices is represented by circular array `slices` in clockwise
direction.

Return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes which you can have.



**Example 1:**

	Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]    
	Output: 10    
	Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 4, Alice and Bob will pick slices with size 3 and 5 respectively. Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.    

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/18/sample_4_1723.png)**
            
	Input: slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]    
	Output: 16    
	Output: Pick pizza slice of size 8 in each turn. If you pick slice with size 9 your partners will pick slices of size 8.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: slices = [4,1,2,5,8,3,1,9,7]    
	Output: 21    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: slices = [3,1,2]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= slices.length <= 500`
  * `slices.length % 3 == 0`
  * `1 <= slices[i] <= 1000`


**Code:**
