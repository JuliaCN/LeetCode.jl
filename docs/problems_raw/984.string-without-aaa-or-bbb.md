Given two integers `A` and `B`, return **any** string `S` such that:

  * `S` has length `A + B` and contains exactly `A` `'a'` letters, and exactly `B` `'b'` letters;
  * The substring `'aaa'` does not occur in `S`;
  * The substring `'bbb'` does not occur in `S`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: A = 1, B = 2    
	Output: "abb"    
	Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: A = 4, B = 1    
	Output: "aabaa"



**Note:**

  1. `0 <= A <= 100`
  2. `0 <= B <= 100`
  3. It is guaranteed such an `S` exists for the given `A` and `B`.


**Code:**
