Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both
`str1` and `str2` as subsequences.  If multiple answers exist, you may return
any of them.

_(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of
characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen _anywhere_ from
T) results in the string S.)_



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"    
	Output: "cabac"    
	Explanation:    str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".    str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".    The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
  2. `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.


**Code:**
