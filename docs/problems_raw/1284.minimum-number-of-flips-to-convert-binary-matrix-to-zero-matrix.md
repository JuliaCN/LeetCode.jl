Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`. In one step, you can choose one cell and
flip it and all the four neighbours of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to
0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighboors if they share one edge.

Return the _minimum number of steps_ required to convert `mat` to a zero
matrix or **-1** if you cannot.

Binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only.

Zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/28/matrix.png)
            
	Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: mat = [[0]]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: Given matrix is a zero matrix. We don't need to change it.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: mat = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]    
	Output: 6    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[1,0,0]]    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: Given matrix can't be a zero matrix    



**Constraints:**

  * `m == mat.length`
  * `n == mat[0].length`
  * `1 <= m <= 3`
  * `1 <= n <= 3`
  * `mat[i][j]` is 0 or 1.


**Code:**
