Given an integer number `n`, return the difference between the product of its
digits and the sum of its digits.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 234    
	Output: 15     
	Explanation:     Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24     Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9     Result = 24 - 9 = 15    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 4421    
	Output: 21    
	Explanation: Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32     Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11     Result = 32 - 11 = 21    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 10^5`


**Code:**
