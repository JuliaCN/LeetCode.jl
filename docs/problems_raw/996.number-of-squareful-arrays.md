Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, the array is _squareful_ if for
every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations
`A1` and `A2` differ if and only if there is some index `i` such that `A1[i]
!= A2[i]`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [1,17,8]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation:    [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [2,2,2]    
	Output: 1    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
  2. `0 <= A[i] <= 1e9`


**Code:**
