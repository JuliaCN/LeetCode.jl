Given an array of integers `arr`, you are initially positioned at the first
index of the array.

In one step you can jump from index `i` to index:

  * `i + 1` where: `i + 1 < arr.length`.
  * `i - 1` where: `i - 1 >= 0`.
  * `j` where: `arr[i] == arr[j]` and `i != j`.

Return _the minimum number of steps_ to reach the **last index** of the array.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9. Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [7]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: Start index is the last index. You don't need to jump.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: arr = [6,1,9]    
	Output: 2    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: arr = [11,22,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,22,13]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4`
  * `-10^8 <= arr[i] <= 10^8`


**Code:**
