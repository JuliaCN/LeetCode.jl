Given a **non-empty** integer array of size _n_ , find the minimum number of
moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing
_n_ \- 1 elements by 1.

**Example:**
            
	Input:    [1,2,3]        
	Output:    3        
	Explanation:    Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):        [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]    


**Code:**
