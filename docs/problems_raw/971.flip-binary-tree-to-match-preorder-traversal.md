Given a binary tree with `N` nodes, each node has a different value from `{1,
..., N}`.

A node in this binary tree can be _flipped_  by swapping the left child and
the right child of that node.

Consider the sequence of `N` values reported by a preorder traversal starting
from the root.  Call such a sequence of `N` values the  _voyage_  of the tree.

(Recall that a _preorder traversal_  of a node means we report the current
node's value, then preorder-traverse the left child, then preorder-traverse
the right child.)

Our goal is to flip the **least number** of nodes in the tree so that the
voyage of the tree matches the `voyage` we are given.

If we can do so, then return a list of the values of all nodes flipped.  You
may return the answer in any order.

If we cannot do so, then return the list `[-1]`.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-01.png)**
            
	Input: root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]    
	Output: [-1]    

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-02.png)**
            
	Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]    
	Output: [1]    

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-02.png)**
            
	Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,2,3]    
	Output: []
