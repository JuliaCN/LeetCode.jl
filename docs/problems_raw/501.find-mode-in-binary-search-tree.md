Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the
[mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_\(statistics\)) (the most
frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

  * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
  * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
  * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



For example:  
Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,
               1        \         2        /       2    



return `[2]`.

**Note:** If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that
the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).


**Code:**
