Given a 2D array `A`, each cell is 0 (representing sea) or 1 (representing
land)

A move consists of walking from one land square 4-directionally to another
land square, or off the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of land squares in the grid for which we **cannot** walk off
the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation:    There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that isn't enclosed because its on the boundary.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation:    All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 500`
  2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 500`
  3. `0 <= A[i][j] <= 1`
  4. All rows have the same size.


**Code:**
