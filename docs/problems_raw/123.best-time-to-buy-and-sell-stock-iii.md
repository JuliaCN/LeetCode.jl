Say you have an array for which the _i_ th element is the price of a given
stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_
transactions.

**Note:  **You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e.,
you must sell the stock before you buy again).



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.    Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.    Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: prices = [1]    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`


**Code:**
