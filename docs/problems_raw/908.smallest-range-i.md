Given an array `A` of integers, for each integer `A[i]` we may choose any `x`
with `-K <= x <= K`, and add `x` to `A[i]`.

After this process, we have some array `B`.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of `B` and
the minimum value of `B`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: A = [1], K = 0    
	Output: 0    **Explanation** : B = [1]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: A = [0,10], K = 2    
	Output: 6    **Explanation** : B = [2,8]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: A = [1,3,6], K = 3    
	Output: 0    **Explanation** : B = [3,3,3] or B = [4,4,4]    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
  2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`
  3. `0 <= K <= 10000`


**Code:**
