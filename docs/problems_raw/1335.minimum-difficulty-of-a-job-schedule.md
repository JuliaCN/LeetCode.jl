You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To
work on the `i-th` job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j <
i`).

You have to finish **at least** one task every day. The difficulty of a job
schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The
difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

Given an array of integers `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty
of the `i-th` job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return _the minimum difficulty_ of a job schedule. If you cannot find a
schedule for the jobs return **-1**.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/untitled.png)
            
	Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2    
	Output: 7    
	Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.    Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.    The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7     

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3    
	Output: 15    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6    
	Output: 843    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
  * `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
  * `1 <= d <= 10`


**Code:**
