Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.

We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any
number of times.

Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of
it's children.

How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer **modulo 10 ** 9 + 7**.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: A = [2, 4]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: A = [2, 4, 5, 10]    
	Output: 7    
	Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 1000`.
  2. `2 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9`.


**Code:**
