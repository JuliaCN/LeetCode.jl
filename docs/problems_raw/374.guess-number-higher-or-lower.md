We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is
higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible
results:

  * `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. `pick < num`).
  * `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. `pick > num`).
  * `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. `pick == num`).

Return _the number that I picked_.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 10, pick = 6    
	Output: 6    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 1, pick = 1    
	Output: 1    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: n = 2, pick = 1    
	Output: 1    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: n = 2, pick = 2    
	Output: 2    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
  * `1 <= pick <= n`


**Code:**
