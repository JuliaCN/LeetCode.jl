Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive
elements in its sorted form.

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [3,6,9,1]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either                 (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [10]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.

**Note:**

  * You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
  * Try to solve it in linear time/space.


**Code:**
