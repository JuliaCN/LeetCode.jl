Given a 2D `grid` consisting of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water).  An _island_ is
a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`s.

The grid is said to be **connected** if we have **exactly one  island**,
otherwise is said **disconnected**.

In one day, we are allowed to change **any** single land cell `(1)` into a
water cell `(0)`.

Return _the minimum number of days_ to disconnect the grid.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/13/1926_island.png)**
            
	Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: We need at least 2 days to get a disconnected grid.    Change land grid[1][1] and grid[0][2] to water and get 2 disconnected island.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,1]]    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: Grid of full water is also disconnected ([[1,1]] -> [[0,0]]), 0 islands.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,0,1,0]]    
	Output: 0    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,1,0,1,1],                   [1,1,1,1,1],                   [1,1,0,1,1],                   [1,1,0,1,1]]    
	Output: 1    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: grid = [[1,1,0,1,1],                   [1,1,1,1,1],                   [1,1,0,1,1],                   [1,1,1,1,1]]    
	Output: 2    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30`
  * `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.


**Code:**
