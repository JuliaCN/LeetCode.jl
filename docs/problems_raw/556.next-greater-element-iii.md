Given a positive integer `n`, find _the smallest integer which has exactly the
same digits existing in the integer_ `n` _and is greater in value than_ `n`.
If no such positive integer exists, return `-1`.

**Note** that the returned integer should fit in **32-bit integer** , if there
is a valid answer but it does not fit in **32-bit integer** , return `-1`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 12    
	Output: 21    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 21    
	Output: -1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`


**Code:**
