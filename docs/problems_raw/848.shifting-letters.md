We have a string `S` of lowercase letters, and an integer array `shifts`.

Call the _shift_ of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping
around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`).

For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i+1` letters of `S`,
`x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `S` are applied.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]    
	Output: "rpl"    
	Explanation:    We start with "abc".    After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc".    After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc".    After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.    

**Note:**

  1. `1 <= S.length = shifts.length <= 20000`
  2. `0 <= shifts[i] <= 10 ^ 9`


**Code:**
