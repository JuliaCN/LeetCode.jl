Given the **API** `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the
range `[1, 7]`, write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random
integer in the range `[1, 10]`. You can only call the API `rand7()`, and you
shouldn't call any other API. Please **do not** use a language's built-in
random API.

Each test case will have one **internal** argument `n`, the number of times
that your implemented function `rand10()` will be called while testing. Note
that this is **not an argument** passed to `rand10()`.

**Follow up:**

  * What is the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) for the number of calls to `rand7()` function?
  * Could you minimize the number of calls to `rand7()`?



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 1    
	Output: [2]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 2    
	Output: [2,8]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: n = 3    
	Output: [3,8,10]    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`


**Code:**
