Given an array of integers A, a _move_ consists of choosing any `A[i]`, and
incrementing it by `1`.

Return the least number of moves to make every value in `A` unique.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [1,2,2]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].    It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.    



**Note:**

  1. `0 <= A.length <= 40000`
  2. `0 <= A[i] < 40000`




**Code:**
