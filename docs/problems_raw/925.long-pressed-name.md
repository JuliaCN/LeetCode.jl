Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a
character `c`, the key might get _long pressed_ , and the character will be
typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard.  Return `True` if it is
possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none)
being long pressed.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"    
	Output: true    
	Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"    
	Output: false    
	Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"    
	Output: true    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"    
	Output: true    
	Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= name.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= typed.length <= 1000`
  * The characters of `name` and `typed` are lowercase letters.


**Code:**
