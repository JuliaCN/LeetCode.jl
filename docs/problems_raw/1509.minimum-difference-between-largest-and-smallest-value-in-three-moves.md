Given an array `nums`, you are allowed to choose one element of `nums` and
change it by any value in one move.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums`
after perfoming at most 3 moves.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [ **2** , **2** ,2, **2** ].    The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1, **1** ,0, **1** , **1** ].     The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]    
	Output: 2    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,5,6,14,15]    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  * `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`


**Code:**
