Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the
first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that
position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]    
	Output: true    
	Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]    
	Output: false    
	Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
  * `0 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^5`


**Code:**
