Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of
the two numbers such that they add up to`target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_ one solution**, and you
may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9    
	Output: [0,1]    
	Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6    
	Output: [1,2]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6    
	Output: [0,1]    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 103`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `-109 <= target <= 109`
  * **Only one valid answer exists.**


**Code:**
