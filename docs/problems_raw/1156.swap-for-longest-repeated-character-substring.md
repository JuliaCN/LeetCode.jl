Given a string `text`, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the
string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: text = "ababa"    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa", which its length is 3.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: text = "aaabaaa"    
	Output: 6    
	Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa", which its length is 6.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: text = "aaabbaaa"    
	Output: 4    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: text = "aaaaa"    
	Output: 5    
	Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa", length is 5.    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: text = "abcdef"    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= text.length <= 20000`
  * `text` consist of lowercase English characters only.
