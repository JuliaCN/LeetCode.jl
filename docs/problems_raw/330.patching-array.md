Given a sorted positive integer array _nums_ and an integer _n_ , add/patch
elements to the array such that any number in range `[1, n]` inclusive can be
formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of
patches required.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: _nums_ = [1,3], _n_ = 6    
	Output: 1     
	Explanation:    Combinations of _nums_ are [1], [3], [1,3], which form possible sums of: 1, 3, 4.    Now if we add/patch 2 to _nums_ , the combinations are: [1], [2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].    Possible sums are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which now covers the range [1, 6].    So we only need 1 patch.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: _nums_ = [1,5,10], _n_ = 20    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: The two patches can be [2, 4].    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: _nums_ = [1,2,2], _n_ = 5    
	Output: 0    


**Code:**
