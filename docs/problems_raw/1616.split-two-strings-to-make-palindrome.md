You are given two strings `a` and `b` of the same length. Choose an index and
split both strings **at the same index** , splitting `a` into two strings:
`aprefix` and `asuffix` where `a = aprefix + asuffix`, and splitting `b` into
two strings: `bprefix` and `bsuffix` where `b = bprefix + bsuffix`. Check if
`aprefix + bsuffix` or `bprefix + asuffix` forms a palindrome.

When you split a string `s` into `sprefix` and `ssuffix`, either `ssuffix` or
`sprefix` is allowed to be empty. For example, if `s = "abc"`, then `"" +
"abc"`, `"a" + "bc"`, `"ab" + "c"` , and `"abc" + ""` are valid splits.

Return `true` _if it is possible to form_ _a palindrome string, otherwise
return_`false`.

**Notice** that `x + y` denotes the concatenation of strings `x` and `y`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: a = "x", b = "y"    
	Output: true    **Explaination:** If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:    aprefix = "", asuffix = "x"    bprefix = "", bsuffix = "y"    Then, aprefix + bsuffix = "" + "y" = "y", which is a palindrome.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: a = "abdef", b = "fecab"    
	Output: true    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu"    
	Output: true    **Explaination:** Split them at index 3:    aprefix = "ula", asuffix = "cfd"    bprefix = "jiz", bsuffix = "alu"    Then, aprefix + bsuffix = "ula" + "alu" = "ulaalu", which is a palindrome.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: a = "xbdef", b = "xecab"    
	Output: false    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105`
  * `a.length == b.length`
  * `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters


**Code:**
