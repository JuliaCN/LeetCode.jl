Given `n` `points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return _  the
**widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the
area._

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the
y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with
the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered
included in the area.



**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png)​
            
	Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == points.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `points[i].length == 2`
  * `0 <= xi, yi <= 109`


**Code:**
