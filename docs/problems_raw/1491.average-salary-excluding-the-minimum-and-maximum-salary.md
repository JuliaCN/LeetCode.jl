Given an array of **unique** integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is the salary
of the employee `i`.

Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum
salary.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]    
	Output: 2500.00000    
	Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.    Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000)/2= 2500    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: salary = [1000,2000,3000]    
	Output: 2000.00000    
	Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 3000 respectively.    Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000)/1= 2000    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: salary = [6000,5000,4000,3000,2000,1000]    
	Output: 3500.00000    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: salary = [8000,9000,2000,3000,6000,1000]    
	Output: 4750.00000    



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= salary.length <= 100`
  * `10^3 <= salary[i] <= 10^6`
  * `salary[i]` is unique.
  * Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
