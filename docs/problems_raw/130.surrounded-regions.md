Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` ( **the letter O** ), capture all
regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded
region.

**Example:**
            X X X X    X O O X    X X O X    X O X X    

After running your function, the board should be:
            X X X X    X X X X    X X X X    X O X X    


	Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldn't be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on
the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the
border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to
`'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
horizontally or vertically.
