Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a
rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes.

If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]    
	Output: 4    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[4,1],[4,3]]    
	Output: 2    



**Note** :

  1. `1 <= points.length <= 500`
  2. `0 <= points[i][0] <= 40000`
  3. `0 <= points[i][1] <= 40000`
  4. All points are distinct.


**Code:**
