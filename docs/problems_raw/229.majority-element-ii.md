Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊
n/3 ⌋` times.

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [3,2,3]    
	Output: [3]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [1]    
	Output: [1]    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,2]    
	Output: [1,2]    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`


**Code:**
