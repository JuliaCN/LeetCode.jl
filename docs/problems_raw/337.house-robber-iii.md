The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only
one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has
one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that
"all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact
the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without
alerting the police.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]             3        / \       2   3        \   \          3   1        
	Output: 7     
	Explanation:  Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = **7**.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]             3        / \       4   5      / \   \      1   3   1        
	Output: 9    
	Explanation:  Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = **9**.    


**Code:**
