Given an array `points` containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane,
sorted by the x-values, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` such that `xi < xj` for
all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. You are also given an integer `k`.

Find the _maximum value of the equation_`yi + yj + |xi - xj|` where `|xi - xj|
<= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. It is guaranteed that there exists at
least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint `|xi - xj| <= k`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.    No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= points.length <= 10^5`
  * `points[i].length == 2`
  * `-10^8 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8`
  * `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^8`
  * `points[i][0] < points[j][0]` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`
  * `xi` form a strictly increasing sequence.


**Code:**
