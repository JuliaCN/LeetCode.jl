A _full binary tree_  is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2
children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with `N` nodes.  Each element
of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each `node` of each tree in the answer **must** have `node.val = 0`.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: 7    
	Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
