You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number
of times:

  * If the element is **even** , **divide** it by `2`.     * For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3, _2_ ].`
  * If the element is **odd** , **multiply** it by `2`.     * For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[ _2_ ,2,3,4].`

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two
elements in the array.

Return _the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some
number of operations._



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3, _2_ ], then to [ _2_ ,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: You can transform the array after two operations to [4, _2_ ,5, _5_ ,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [2,10,8]    
	Output: 3    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == nums.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`


**Code:**
