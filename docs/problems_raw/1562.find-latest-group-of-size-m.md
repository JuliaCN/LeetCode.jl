Given an array `arr` that represents a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.
You have a binary string of size `n` that initially has all its bits set to
zero.

At each step `i` (assuming both the binary string and `arr` are 1-indexed)
from `1` to `n`, the bit at position `arr[i]` is set to `1`. You are given an
integer `m` and you need to find the latest step at which there exists a group
of ones of length `m`. A group of ones is a contiguous substring of 1s such
that it cannot be extended in either direction.

Return _the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length
**exactly**_  `m`. _If no such group exists, return_  `-1`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [3,5,1,2,4], m = 1    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: Step 1: "00 _1_ 00", groups: ["1"]    Step 2: "0010 _1_ ", groups: ["1", "1"]    Step 3: " _1_ 0101", groups: ["1", "1", "1"]    Step 4: "1 _1_ 101", groups: ["111", "1"]    Step 5: "111 _1_ 1", groups: ["11111"]    The latest step at which there exists a group of size 1 is step 4.

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [3,1,5,4,2], m = 2    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: Step 1: "00 _1_ 00", groups: ["1"]    Step 2: " _1_ 0100", groups: ["1", "1"]    Step 3: "1010 _1_ ", groups: ["1", "1", "1"]    Step 4: "101 _1_ 1", groups: ["1", "111"]    Step 5: "1 _1_ 111", groups: ["11111"]    No group of size 2 exists during any step.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = [1], m = 1    
	Output: 1    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: arr = [2,1], m = 2    
	Output: 2    



**Constraints:**

  * `n == arr.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 10^5`
  * `1 <= arr[i] <= n`
  * All integers in `arr` are  **distinct**.
  * `1 <= m <= arr.length`


**Code:**
