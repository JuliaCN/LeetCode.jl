Design and implement a data structure for [Least Frequently Used
(LFU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used) cache.

Implement the `LFUCache` class:

  * `LFUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the `capacity` of the data structure.
  * `int get(int key)` Gets the value of the `key` if the `key` exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns `-1`.
  * `void put(int key, int value)` Sets or inserts the value if the `key` is not already present. When the cache reaches its `capacity`, it should invalidate the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), **the least recently** used `key` would be evicted.

**Notice  that** the number of times an item is used is the number of calls to
the `get` and `put` functions for that item since it was inserted. This number
is set to zero when the item is removed.



**Example 1:**
            **Input**    ["LFUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]    [[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]    **Output**    [null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]        **Explanation**    LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);    lfu.put(1, 1);    lfu.put(2, 2);    lfu.get(1);      // return 1    lfu.put(3, 3);   // evicts key 2    lfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)    lfu.get(3);      // return 3    lfu.put(4, 4);   // evicts key 1.    lfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)    lfu.get(3);      // return 3    lfu.get(4);      // return 4    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= capacity, key, value <= 104`
  * At most `105` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.
