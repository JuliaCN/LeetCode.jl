A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the
following mapping:
            'A' -> 1    'B' -> 2    ...    'Z' -> 26    

Given a **non-empty** string containing only digits, determine the total
number of ways to decode it.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: s = "12"    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: s = "226"    
	Output: 3    
	Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: s = "0"    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with '0'. We cannot ignore a zero when we face it while decoding. So, each '0' should be part of "10" --> 'J' or "20" --> 'T'.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: s = "1"    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).


**Code:**
