Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a
**non-empty** subsequence of that array such that for every two
**consecutive** integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i
< j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.

A  _subsequence_  of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements
(can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original
order.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2    
	Output: 37    
	Explanation: The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20].    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [10,-2,-10,-5,20], k = 2    
	Output: 23    
	Explanation: The subsequence is [10, -2, -5, 20].    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  * `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`


**Code:**
