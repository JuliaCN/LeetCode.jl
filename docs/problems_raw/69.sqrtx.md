Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated** ,
and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: x = 4    
	Output: 2    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: x = 8    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`


**Code:**
