Given a **sorted** (in ascending order) integer array `nums` of `n` elements
and a `target` value, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If
`target` exists, then return its index, otherwise return `-1`.

  
**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9    
	Output: 4    
	Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4        

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2    
	Output: -1    
	Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1    



**Note:**

  1. You may assume that all elements in `nums` are unique.
  2. `n` will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
  3. The value of each element in `nums` will be in the range `[-9999, 9999]`.


**Code:**
