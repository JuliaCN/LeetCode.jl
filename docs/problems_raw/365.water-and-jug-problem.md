You are given two jugs with capacities _x_ and _y_ litres. There is an
infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is
possible to measure exactly _z_ litres using these two jugs.

If _z_ liters of water is measurable, you must have _z_ liters of water
contained within **one or both buckets** by the end.

Operations allowed:

  * Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
  * Empty any of the jugs.
  * Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.

**Example 1:** (From the famous [_" Die Hard"_
example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg))
            Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4    Output: True    

**Example 2:**
            Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5    Output: False    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= x <= 10^6`
  * `0 <= y <= 10^6`
  * `0 <= z <= 10^6`


**Code:**
