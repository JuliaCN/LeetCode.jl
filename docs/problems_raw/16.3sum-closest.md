Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, find three
integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of
the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one
solution.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1    
	Output: 2    
	Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).    



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
  * `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
  * `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`


**Code:**
