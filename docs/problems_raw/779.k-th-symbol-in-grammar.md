On the first row, we write a `0`. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the
previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence
of `1` with `10`.

Given row `N` and index `K`, return the `K`-th indexed symbol in row `N`. (The
values of `K` are 1-indexed.) (1 indexed).
            **Examples:**    
	Input: N = 1, K = 1    
	Output: 0        
	Input: N = 2, K = 1    
	Output: 0        
	Input: N = 2, K = 2    
	Output: 1        
	Input: N = 4, K = 5    
	Output: 1        
	Explanation:    row 1: 0    row 2: 01    row 3: 0110    row 4: 01101001    

**Note:**

  1. `N` will be an integer in the range `[1, 30]`.
  2. `K` will be an integer in the range `[1, 2^(N-1)]`.


**Code:**
